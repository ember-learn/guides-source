          PULL_REQUEST_TITLE: Octane Tutorial Updates
          PULL_REQUEST_BODY: >
            This is an *[automated](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/blob/super-rentals-tutorial/.github/workflows/tutorial-ingestion.yml)*
            pull request to let you know there are new content available for
            the revamped Octane tutorial!


            If these changes look good to you, it is recommended that you merge
            the PR using the *Squash and merge* feature.


            If there are any issues with the content here, *do not edit these
            files directly* â€“ the original source lives in the
            [super-rentals-tutorial repo](https://github.com/ember-learn/super-rentals-tutorial).


            Feel free to hold off on merging this PR and file an issue/PR in
            the upstream repo. After fixing the issues there, the [upstream CI
            job](https://travis-ci.org/ember-learn/super-rentals-tutorial) will
            push the changes to [this pull request branch](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/commits/super-rentals-tutorial),
            automatically, so you should see the changes relected in this PR
            shortly after.


            That being said, it's totally *okay* to push *other* changes to the
            `super-rentals-tutorial` branch manually, like making changes to
            the TOC or adding words to the dictionary. Just don't edit the
            markdown files themselves, since any changes you make will be wiped
            out by the next upstream CI job.


            You can rebase the branch and force-push, or even delete it! The CI
            job clones the branch fresh on each build, and re-creates it from
            the octane branch if needed, so there shouldn't be any issues with
            conflicts and such.
