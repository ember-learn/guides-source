        PULL_REQUEST_TITLE: Octane Tutorial Updates
        PULL_REQUEST_BODY: >
          This is an *[automated](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/blob/master/.github/workflows/tutorial-ingestion.yml)*
          pull request to let you know there are new content available for the
          revamped Octane tutorial!
          
          These files should not be edited directly – the original source lives
          in the [super-rentals-tutorial repo](https://github.com/ember-learn/super-rentals-tutorial).

          If there are any issues with the content here, feel free to hold off
          on merging this PR. After fixing the issue on the upstream repo, this
          branch/pull request will be updated [automatically](https://travis-ci.org/ember-learn/super-rentals-tutorial)
          shortly after.
          
          It is *okay* to push changes to the `super-rentals-tutorial` branch
          manually, just don't edit the markdown files, since any changes will
          be wiped out by the next CI job.
          
          However, it's totally fine to push other changes, like TOC changes,
          dictionary fixes, etc. You can even rebase and force-push! The CI job
          clones the branch fresh on each build, so there shouldn't be any
          issues with conflicts and such.
          
          However, do not delete the `super-rentals-tutorial` branch itself!
