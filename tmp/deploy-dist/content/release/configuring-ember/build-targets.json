Just as with your application code,\nEmber CLI ships with a sensible set of defaults to compile and bundle the assets that can be deployed\nto production. Under the hood, this is accomplished using a series of Broccoli plugins, each of which\ncan be configured in the `ember-cli-build.js` file at the root of your project.\n\nEmber CLI uses [Babel.js](https://babeljs.io/) for the compile step in this process. If you've used Babel\nbefore, you know that it comes with a large set of options, including the ability to configure\n\"targets\"; i.e. the environments in which your application is expected to run.\nFor example, if your application is embedded in an [Electron app](https://www.electronjs.org),\nyou might only care about compiling for the latest Chromium build. Or if your app targets Enterprise\nusers, you may need to compile your JavaScript to older syntax that runs in IE11.\n\nFor any of these cases, you can configure `ember build` to do The Right Thing. You can read more about\nthis in [the Ember CLI Guides](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/advanced-use/build-targets/)!","description":"Ember application builds are created by the Ember CLI build pipeline.
