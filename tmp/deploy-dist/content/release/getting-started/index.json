{"data":{"type":"contents","id":"getting-started/index","attributes":{"content":"## What is Ember?\n\nEmber.js is a productive, battle-tested JavaScript framework for building modern web applications.\nIt includes everything you need to build rich UIs that work on any device. It does so by providing\ndevelopers many features that are essential to manage complexity in modern web applications,\nas well as an integrated development toolkit that enables rapid iteration.\n\nSome of these features that you'll learn about in the guides are:\n\n* [Ember CLI](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/) - A robust development toolkit to create, develop, and build Ember applications. Learn [basic commands](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/basic-use/cli-commands/) from the CLI Guides.\n* [Components](../components/) - The fundamental construct used in Ember applications, used to create reusable UI elements and define the layout and the functionality of the app.\n* [Routing](../routing/) - A central part of an Ember application. Enables developers to drive the application state from the URL.\n* [Services](../services/) - The way to store long-term state in your application and pass it around.\n* [Ember Data](../models/) - Ember Data provides a consistent way to communicate with external APIs and manage application state\n* [Ember Inspector](../ember-inspector/) - A browser extension, or bookmarklet, to inspect your application live. It's also useful for spotting Ember applications in the wild, try to install it and open up the [NASA website](https://www.nasa.gov/)!\n\n## Organization\n\nOn the left side of each Guides page is a table of contents,\norganized into sections that can be expanded to show the topics\nthey cover. Both the sections and the topics within each section are\nordered from basic to advanced concepts.\n\nThe Guides are intended to contain practical explanations of how to\nbuild Ember apps, focusing on the most widely-used features of Ember.js.\nFor comprehensive documentation of every Ember feature and API, see the\n[Ember.js API documentation](https://api.emberjs.com/).\n\nThe Guides begin with an explanation of how to get started with Ember,\nfollowed by a tutorial on how to build your first Ember app.\nIf you're brand new to Ember,\nwe recommend you start off by following along with these first two sections of the Guides.\n\n## Assumptions\n\nWhile we try to make the Guides as beginner-friendly as we can, we must\nestablish a baseline so that the guides can keep focused on Ember.js\nfunctionality. We will try to link to appropriate documentation whenever a\nconcept is introduced.\n\nTo make the most out of the guides, you should have a working knowledge of\n**HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** - the building blocks of web pages. You can find\nout more about each of these technologies in the [Working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](./working-with-html-css-and-javascript)\nguide, including some of the special features that Ember uses such as class\nfields and decorators.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nIf you are using a screen reader while you go through the Guides, we recommend using Firefox and NVDA or Safari and VoiceOver for the best experience.\n\n## Reporting a problem\n\nTypos, missing words, and code samples with errors are all considered\ndocumentation bugs. If you spot one of them, or want to otherwise improve\nthe existing guides, we are happy to help you help us!\n\nSome of the more common ways to report a problem with the guides are:\n\n* Using the pencil icon on the top-right of each guide page\n* Opening an issue or pull request to [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/)\n\nClicking the pencil icon will bring you to GitHub's editor for that\nguide so you can edit right away, using the Markdown markup language.\nThis is the fastest way to correct a typo, a missing word, or an error in\na code sample.\n\nIf you wish to make a more significant contribution be sure to check our\n[issue tracker](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues) to see if your issue is already being addressed. If you don't find an active issue, open a new one.\n\nIf you have any questions about styling or the contributing process, you\ncan check out our [contributing guide](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). If your question persists, reach us in the `#dev-ember-learning` channel on the [Ember Community Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS).\n\nGood luck!","description":"What is Ember? \n\nEmber.js is a productive, battle-tested JavaScript framework for building modern web applications.
