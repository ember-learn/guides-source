{"data":{"type":"contents","id":"ember-inspector/object-inspector","attributes":{"content":"The Inspector includes a panel that allows you to view and interact with your Ember objects.\nTo open it, click on any Ember object. You can then view the object's properties.\n\n\n### Viewing Objects\n\nHere's what you see when you click on an object:\n\n<img src=\"/images/guides/ember-inspector/v4.3.4/object-inspector-controller.png\" width=\"450\">\n\nThe Inspector displays the parent objects and mixins that are composed into the chosen object, including the inherited properties.\n\nEach property value in this view is bound to your application, so if the value of a\nproperty updates in your app, it will be reflected in the Inspector.\n\nNote, each property is preceded by a letter icon to help you distinguish its type. For example, the letter G for a getter and the letter T for a tracked property. You can hover over the letter icon to learn more about the property.\n\n\n### Exposing Objects to the Console\n\n#### Sending from the Inspector to the Console\n\nYou can expose objects to the console by clicking on the `$E` button within the Inspector.\nThis will set the global `$E` variable to the chosen object.\n\n<img src=\"/images/guides/ember-inspector/v4.3.4/object-inspector-$E.png\"\nwidth=\"450\">\n\nYou can also expose properties to the console. When you hover over an object's properties, a `$E` button will appear\nnext to every property. Click on it to expose the property's value to the\nconsole.\n\n<img src=\"/images/guides/ember-inspector/v4.3.4/object-inspector-property-$E.png\" width=\"450\">\n\n\n#### Sending from the Console to the Inspector\n\nYou can send Ember objects and arrays to the Inspector by using\n`EmberInspector.inspect` within the console.\n\n```javascript\nlet object = Ember.Object.create();\nEmberInspector.inspect(object);\n```\n\nMake sure the Inspector is active when you call this method.\n\n\n\n### Editing Properties\n\nYou can edit `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean` properties in the Inspector.\nYour changes will be reflected immediately in your app. Click on a property's value to start editing it.\n\n<img src=\"/images/guides/ember-inspector/v4.3.4/object-inspector-edit.png\"\nwidth=\"450\">\n\nEdit the property and press the `ENTER` key to commit the change, or `ESC` to cancel.\n\n### Navigating the Inspector\n\nIn addition to inspecting the properties above, you can inspect properties that hold Ember objects or arrays.\nClick on the property's value to inspect it.\n\n<img src=\"/images/guides/ember-inspector/v4.3.4/object-inspector-object-property.png\" width=\"450\">\n\nYou can continue drill into the Inspector as long as properties contain either an\nEmber object or an array.\nIn the image below, we clicked on the `model` property first, then clicked\non the `store` property.\n\n<img src=\"/images/guides/ember-inspector/v4.3.4/object-inspector-nested-objects.png\" width=\"450\">\n\nYou can see the path to the current object at the top of the\nInspector. You can go back to the previous object by clicking on the\nleft-facing arrow at the top left.\n\n### Custom Property Grouping\n\nSome properties are not only grouped by inheritance, but also\nby framework level semantics. For example, if you inspect an Ember Data\nmodel, you can see `Attributes`, `Belongs To`, `Has Many`, and `Flags`\ngroups.\n\n<img src=\"/images/guides/ember-inspector/v4.3.4/object-inspector-model.png\"\nwidth=\"450\">\n\nLibrary authors can customize how any object will display in the Inspector.\nBy defining a `_debugInfo` method, an object can tell the Inspector how it should be rendered.\nFor an example on how to customize an object's properties, see [Ember Data's\ncustomization](https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/f1be2af71d7402d034bc034d9502733647cad295/packages/ember-data/lib/system/debug/debug_info.js).","description":"The Inspector includes a panel that allows you to view and interact with your Ember objects.
