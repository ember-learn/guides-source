Click on the `Promises` menu to start inspecting them.\n\n\n<img src=\"/images/guides/ember-inspector/v4.3.4/promises-screenshot.png\" width=\"680\" />\n\nYou can see a hierarchical list of Promises with labels describing each\nPromise, its state, its settled value, and the time it took to\nsettle.\n\n\n### Promise States and Filtering\n\nPromises have different colors based on their state.\n\n<img src=\"/images/guides/ember-inspector/promises-fulfilled.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n\n<img src=\"/images/guides/ember-inspector/promises-pending.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n\n<img src=\"/images/guides/ember-inspector/promises-rejected.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n\nYou can filter by clicking on the following pills: `Rejected`, `Pending`, `Fulfilled`.\n\n<img src=\"/images/guides/ember-inspector/v4.3.4/promises-toolbar.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n\nYou can also search for Promises by typing a query in the search box.\n\nTo clear the currently logged Promises, click on the clear icon on the\ntop left of the tab.\n\n### Inspecting Settled Values\n\nIf the fulfillment value of a Promise is an Ember object or an array, you can click\non that object to open it in the Object Inspector.\n\n<img src=\"/images/guides/ember-inspector/promises-object-inspector.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n\nIf the rejection value is an `Error` object, you can send its stack trace to\nthe console.\n\n<img src=\"/images/guides/ember-inspector/promises-error.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n\nYou can also click on the `$E` button to send the value to the console.\n\n### Tracing\n\nThe Inspector provides a way to view a Promise's stack trace.\nTracing Promises is disabled by default for performance reasons. To\nenable tracing, check the `Trace promise` checkbox. You may want to\nreload to trace existing Promises.\n\n<img src=\"/images/guides/ember-inspector/v4.3.4/promises-trace-checkbox.png\"\nwidth=\"680\"/>\n\nTo trace a Promise, click on the `Trace` button next to the label,\nwhich will send the Promise stack trace to the console.\n\n<img src=\"/images/guides/ember-inspector/promises-trace.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n\n### Labeling Promises\n\nPromises generated by Ember are all labeled by default.\nYou can also label your own RSVP Promises to find them in the Inspector's Promises tab.\nAll RSVP methods can take a label as the final argument.\n\n```javascript\n\nlet label = 'Find Posts'\n\nnew RSVP.Promise(method, label);\n\nRSVP.Promise.resolve(value, label);\n\nRSVP.Promise.reject(reason, label);\n\nRSVP.Promise.all(array, label);\n\nRSVP.Promise.hash(hash, label);\n\npromise.then(success, failure, label);\n\npromise.catch(callback, label);\n\npromise.finally(callback, label);\n\n```\n\n<!-- eof - needed for pages that end in a code block  -->","description":"The Inspector provides a way to look at all Promises created in your application.
