A route handler can do several things:\n\n* It can render a template.\n* It can load a model that is then available to the template.\n* It can redirect to a new route, such as if the user isn't allowed to visit\nthat part of the app.\n* It can handle actions that involve changing a model or transitioning to a new route.","description":"Imagine we are writing a web app for managing a blog.
