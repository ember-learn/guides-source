Many can also be made by passing them as arguments to the command line program.\n\nFor example, a common desire is to change the port that Ember CLI serves the app from. It's possible to pass the port number from the command line with `ember server --port 8080`. To make this configuration permanent, edit your `.ember-cli` file like so:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"port\": 8080\n}\n```\n\nFor a full list of command line options, run `ember help`.\n\nMore information on configuring the Ember CLI can be found in the [CLI Guides](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/appendix/configuration/).","description":"In addition to configuring your app itself, you can also configure Ember CLI.
