# Maintainers

This document contains instructions and guidelines for maintainer tasks, like publishing and deploying new versions of the Guides.

## Continuous deployment

Whenever a PR is merged into `master`, Travis will automatically run the scripts that build the app and upload the results to Netlify. Netlify will then deploy the site. We currently allow only one Travis job at a time so that concurrent deploy commands do not cause a conflict.

## Deploying a new version

Whenever the release blog post is published for a new version of Ember, follow these steps.

### Before deployment of a new version

Check briefly to see if there are any PRs that should be merged into `/release/`, so that they are applied to both the new version we are about to deploy, and the previous version.

### To deploy a new version

It is required that all maintainers use 2FA (two factor authentication). These are the permissions needed for a deployment of the Guides:

- Merge permissions on the repository
- Percy dashboard

1. Clone the guides-source repository to your local machine
2. Make sure you have a clean git history with `git status`
3. Get the latest commits on `master` using `git pull origin master`
4. Make a branch, i.e. `git checkout -b release-new-version`
5. Create a directory in `guides` for the version that is one less than the "lastest." For example, if the newest release of Ember is `3.9`, you will make a directory for `3.8` that is a copy of `release`. `mkdir guides/vX.Y.0`
6. Copy the contents of `guides/release/` into the new directory, `cp -r release/* vX.Y.0/`
7. Edit `versions.yml` - add the version number to _both_ the end of the list and the `currentVersion`. The last item and `currentVersion` should match.
8. Double check that the new directory that you made is the latest release minus one. Commit the changes and push your branch.
9. Create a PR, and in the comments, mention that when it is merged, the person who merges it must update the guides search ASAP, and include a link to this page for instructions. Look at the app in staging, get a review, and merge to `master`. This will trigger an auto deployment.
10. Once it is deployed, follow the steps below to get the website search working for your new version.

### Updating the guides search

Currently getting the new version indexed and put in Algolia is a semi-manual step. There is currently work going on to try to make this automatic, see the [tracking issue here](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/487) to follow along with progress.

To proceed, run `yarn run release:search` and you will be presented with instructions.
