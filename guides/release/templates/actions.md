Your app will often need a way to let users interact with controls that change
application state. For example, imagine that you have a template that shows a
blog title, and supports expanding the post to show the body. This can be done
with _actions_.

Actions are methods that have been decorated with the `@action` decorator in
the context of the template:

```javascript {data-filename=app/components/post/component.js}
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class Post extends Component {
  @tracked isShowingBody;

  @action
  toggleBody() {
    this.isShowingBody = !this.isShowingBody;
  }
}
```

You can then add this action to an element using the
[`{{action}}`](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/action?anchor=action)
modifier:

```handlebars {data-filename=app/components/post/template.hbs}
<h3>
  <button {{action this.toggleBody}}>{{@title}}</button>
</h3>

{{#if this.isShowingBody}}
  <p>{{@body}}</p>
{{/if}}
```

The `{{action}}` modifier calls your action function when the element is
clicked. You will learn about more advanced usages in the Component's [Actions
and Events](../../components/actions-and-events/) guide, but you should
familiarize yourself with the basics on this page first.

Templates rendered for your application's routes are backed by controllers, so
you may also see actions defined on a controller using the same `@action`
decorator.

<div class="cta">
  <div class="cta-note">
    <div class="cta-note-body">
      <div class="cta-note-heading">Zoey says...</div>
      <div class="cta-note-message">
If this doesn't seem familiar you might be looking for documentation
about Ember components and controller that use the older <code>.extend({</code> syntax.
In those files you define actions in an object on the class then reference
the action name with a string in the template.
For more examples of that syntax see <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/v3.6.0/templates/actions/">previous version of this Guide entry</a>.
      </div>
    </div>
    <img src="/images/mascots/zoey.png" role="presentation" alt="Ember Mascot">
  </div>
</div>

## Action Parameters

You can optionally pass arguments to the action
helper. For example, if the `post` argument was passed:

```handlebars {data-filename=app/components/post/template.hbs}
<p>
  <button {{action this.select @post}}>
    âœ“
  </button>
  {{this.selectedPost.title}}
</p>
```

The `select` action handler would be called with a single argument
containing the post model:

```javascript {data-filename=app/components/post/component.js}
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class Post extends Component {
  @tracked selectedPost;

  @action
  select(post) {
    this.selectedPost = post;
  }
}
```

## Attaching Actions to Other Events

Actions don't need to be triggered on click, in fact they can be attached
to any event Ember is already listening to. For example this form will
call the `updateText` action when submitted, but prevent the default
form submission logic in the browser from running:

```handlebars {data-filename=app/components/post/template.hbs}
<form {{action this.createPost on="submit" preventDefault=true}}>
  Post title: <Input @value={{this.title}} />
</form>
```

```javascript {data-filename=app/components/post/component.js}
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class Post extends Component {
  @tracked title;

  @action
  createPost() {
    // Do something with `this.title`
  }
}
```

## Attaching Actions to Non-Clickable Elements

Note that while Ember currently permits you to add an action to any DOM element, not all DOM elements are eligible to receive focus, according to HTML standards.

For example, if an action is attached to an `a` link
without an `href` attribute, or to a `div`, some browsers won't execute the
associated function.

Always check to see that the element you are adding an action to is interactive, according to
[web accessibility and browser standards](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Interactive_elements).
As a rule of thumb, if you find yourself adding an action an `<a>` tag, you should turn it into a `<button>` instead.

[Accessibility Guide](../../reference/accessibility-guide/).
