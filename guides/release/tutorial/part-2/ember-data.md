In this chapter, we will work on removing some code duplication in our route handlers, by switching to using EmberData to manage our data. The end result looks exactly the same as before:

## What is EmberData?

Now that we've added some features, it's time to do some clean up again!

A while back, we added the `rental` route. If memory serves us well, we didn't do anything too fancy when we added that new route; we just copy-pasted a lot of the same logic from the `index` route.

```js { data-filename="app/routes/index.js" }
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';

const COMMUNITY_CATEGORIES = ['Condo', 'Townhouse', 'Apartment'];

export default class IndexRoute extends Route {
  async model() {
    let response = await fetch('/api/rentals.json');
    let { data } = await response.json();

    return data.map((model) => {
      let { id, attributes } = model;
      let type;

      if (COMMUNITY_CATEGORIES.includes(attributes.category)) {
        type = 'Community';
      } else {
        type = 'Standalone';
      }

      return { id, type, ...attributes };
    });
  }
}
```

```js { data-filename="app/routes/rental.js" }
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';

const COMMUNITY_CATEGORIES = ['Condo', 'Townhouse', 'Apartment'];

export default class RentalRoute extends Route {
  async model(params) {
    let response = await fetch(`/api/rentals/${params.rental_id}.json`);
    let { data } = await response.json();

    let { id, attributes } = data;
    let type;

    if (COMMUNITY_CATEGORIES.includes(attributes.category)) {
      type = 'Community';
    } else {
      type = 'Standalone';
    }

    return { id, type, ...attributes };
  }
}
```

This duplication incurred a bit of _technical debt_ for us, making our code base harder to maintain in the long run. For example, if we wanted to change something about how our data-fetching logic worked, we'd have to change it in _both_ the `index` and `rental` routes. If we changed things in one place, but forgot about the other spot, we could end up with really subtle bugs in our app! Yikes!

Chances are, as we keep working on this app, we will need to add more routes that fetch data from the server. Since all of our server's API endpoints follow the [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) format, we'd have to keep copying this boilerplate for every single new route we add to the app!

Fortunately, we're not going to do any of that. As it turns out, there's a much better solution here: we can use EmberData! As its name implies, [EmberData](../../../models/) is a library that helps manage data and _application state_ in Ember applications.

There's a lot to learn about EmberData, but let's start by uncovering features that help with our immediate problem.

## EmberData Models

EmberData is built around the idea of organizing your app's data into _[model objects](../../../models/defining-models/)_. These objects represent units of information that our application presents to the user. For example, the rental property data we have been working with would be a good candidate.

Enough talking, why don't we give that a try!

```js { data-filename="app/models/rental.js" }
import Model, { attr } from '@ember-data/model';

const COMMUNITY_CATEGORIES = ['Condo', 'Townhouse', 'Apartment'];

export default class RentalModel extends Model {
  @attr title;
  @attr owner;
  @attr city;
  @attr location;
  @attr category;
  @attr image;
  @attr bedrooms;
  @attr description;

  get type() {
    if (COMMUNITY_CATEGORIES.includes(this.category)) {
      return 'Community';
    } else {
      return 'Standalone';
    }
  }
}
```

Here, we created a `RentalModel` class that extends EmberData's `Model` superclass. When fetching the listing data from the server, each individual rental property will be represented by an instance (also known as a _[record](../../../models/finding-records/)_) of our `RentalModel` class.

We used the `@attr` decorator to declare the attributes of a rental property. These attributes correspond directly to the `attributes` data we expect the server to provide in its responses:

```json { data-filename="public/api/rentals/grand-old-mansion.json" }
{
  "data": {
    "type": "rental",
    "id": "grand-old-mansion",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "Grand Old Mansion",
      "owner": "Veruca Salt",
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "location": {
        "lat": 37.7749,
        "lng": -122.4194
      },
      "category": "Estate",
      "bedrooms": 15,
      "image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Crane_estate_(5).jpg",
      "description": "This grand old mansion sits on over 100 acres of rolling hills and dense redwood forests."
    }
  }
}
```

We can access these attributes for an instance of `RentalModel` using standard dot notation, such as `model.title` or `model.location.lat`. In addition to the attributes we declared here, there will always be an implicit _id_ attribute as well, which is used to uniquely identify the model object and can be accessed using `model.id`.

Model classes in EmberData are no different than any other classes we've worked with so far, in that they allow for a convenient place for adding custom behavior. We took advantage of this feature to move our `type` logic (which is a major source of unnecessary duplication in our route handlers) into a getter on our model class. Once we have everything working here, we will go back to clean that up.

Attributes declared with the `@attr` decorator work with the auto-track feature (which we learned about [in a previous chapter](../../part-1/reusable-components/)). Therefore, we are free to reference any model attributes in our getter (`this.category`), and Ember will know when to invalidate its result.

## Testing Models

So far, we haven't had a good place to write tests for the rental property's `type` logic. Now that we have found a home for it in the model class, it also made it easy to test this behavior. We can add a test file for our model using the `model-test` generator:

```shell
$ ember generate model-test rental
installing model-test
  create tests/unit/models/rental-test.js

Running "lint:fix" script...
```

<div class="cta">
  <div class="cta-note">
    <div class="cta-note-body">
      <div class="cta-note-heading">Zoey says...</div>
      <div class="cta-note-message">
        <p>We could also have used the <code>ember generate model rental</code> command in the first place, which would have created both the model and test file for us.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <img src="/images/mascots/zoey.png" role="presentation" alt="">
  </div>
</div>

The generator created some boilerplate code for us, which serves as a pretty good starting point for writing our test:

```js { data-filename="tests/unit/models/rental-test.js" data-diff="-7,-8,+9,-11,-12,+13,+14,+15,+16,+17,+18,+19,+20,+21,+22,+23,+24,+25,+26,+27,+28,+29,+30,+31,+32,+33,+34,+35,+36,+37,+38,+39,+40,+41,+42" }
import { setupTest } from 'super-rentals/tests/helpers';
import { module, test } from 'qunit';

module('Unit | Model | rental', function (hooks) {
  setupTest(hooks);

  // Replace this with your real tests.
  test('it exists', function (assert) {
  test('it has the right type', function (assert) {
    const store = this.owner.lookup('service:store');
    const model = store.createRecord('rental', {});
    assert.ok(model, 'model exists');
    let rental = store.createRecord('rental', {
      id: 'grand-old-mansion',
      title: 'Grand Old Mansion',
      owner: 'Veruca Salt',
      city: 'San Francisco',
      location: {
        lat: 37.7749,
        lng: -122.4194,
      },
      category: 'Estate',
      bedrooms: 15,
      image:
        'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Crane_estate_(5).jpg',
      description:
        'This grand old mansion sits on over 100 acres of rolling hills and dense redwood forests.',
    });

    assert.strictEqual(rental.type, 'Standalone');

    rental.category = 'Condo';
    assert.strictEqual(rental.type, 'Community');

    rental.category = 'Townhouse';
    assert.strictEqual(rental.type, 'Community');

    rental.category = 'Apartment';
    assert.strictEqual(rental.type, 'Community');

    rental.category = 'Estate';
    assert.strictEqual(rental.type, 'Standalone');
  });
});
```

This model test is also known as a _[unit test](../../../testing/testing-models/)_. Unlike any of the other tests that we've written thus far, this test doesn't actually _render_ anything. It just instantiates the rental model object and tests the model object directly, manipulating its attributes and asserting their value.

It is worth pointing out that EmberData provides a `store` _[service](../../../services/)_, also known as the EmberData store. In our test, we used the `this.owner.lookup('service:store')` API to get access to the EmberData store. The store provides a `createRecord` method to instantiate our model object for us. To make this `store` service available, we must add the following file:

```js { data-filename="app/services/store.js" }
export { default } from 'ember-data/store';
```

Running the tests in the browser confirms that everything is working as intended:

## Loading Models in Routes

Alright, now that we have our model set up, it's time to refactor our route handlers to use EmberData and remove the duplication!

```js { data-filename="app/routes/index.js" data-diff="-2,-3,+4,+5,-8,-9,-10,-11,-12,-13,-14,+15,-17,-18,-19,-20,-21,-22,-23,-24,+25,+26,+27" }
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';

const COMMUNITY_CATEGORIES = ['Condo', 'Townhouse', 'Apartment'];
import { service } from '@ember/service';
import { query } from '@ember-data/json-api/request';

export default class IndexRoute extends Route {
  async model() {
    let response = await fetch('/api/rentals.json');
    let { data } = await response.json();

    return data.map((model) => {
      let { id, attributes } = model;
      let type;
  @service store;

      if (COMMUNITY_CATEGORIES.includes(attributes.category)) {
        type = 'Community';
      } else {
        type = 'Standalone';
      }

      return { id, type, ...attributes };
    });
  async model() {
    const { content } = await this.store.request(query('rental'));
    return content.data;
  }
}
```

```js { data-filename="app/routes/rental.js" data-diff="-2,-3,+4,+5,-8,-9,-10,-11,-12,-13,+14,-16,-17,-18,-19,-20,-21,-22,+23,+24,+25,+26,+27" }
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';

const COMMUNITY_CATEGORIES = ['Condo', 'Townhouse', 'Apartment'];
import { service } from '@ember/service';
import { findRecord } from '@ember-data/json-api/request';

export default class RentalRoute extends Route {
  async model(params) {
    let response = await fetch(`/api/rentals/${params.rental_id}.json`);
    let { data } = await response.json();

    let { id, attributes } = data;
    let type;
  @service store;

    if (COMMUNITY_CATEGORIES.includes(attributes.category)) {
      type = 'Community';
    } else {
      type = 'Standalone';
    }

    return { id, type, ...attributes };
  async model(params) {
    const { content } = await this.store.request(
      findRecord('rental', params.rental_id),
    );
    return content.data;
  }
}
```

Wow... that removed a lot of code! This is all possible thanks to the power of conventions!

## The EmberData Store

As mentioned above, EmberData provides a `store` service, which we can inject into our route using the `@service store;` declaration, making the EmberData store available as `this.store`. It provides the `request` method for making fetch requests using `RequestManager`. As its name implies: the `RequestManager` is request centric. Instead of answering questions about specific records or types of records, we ask it about the status of a specific request. To initiate a request, we use the `request` method on the store, passing in a request object. The request object is created using builders from `@ember-data/json-api/request`. Specifically, the [`findRecord` builder](../../../models/finding-records/#toc_retrieving-a-single-record) takes a model type (`rental` in our case) and a model ID (for us, that would be `params.rental_id` from the URL) as arguments and builds fetch options for a single record. On the other hand, the [`query` builder](../../../models/finding-records/#toc_retrieving-multiple-records) takes the model type as an argument and builds fetch options to query for all records of that type.

EmberData can do many things, and in default setup it provides caching. EmberData's store caches server responses, allowing instant access to previously fetched data. If the data is already cached, you don't need to wait for the server to respond again. If not, the store fetches it for you.

That's a lot of theory, but is this going to work in our app? Let's run the tests and find out!

<img src="/images/tutorial/part-2/ember-data/fail-1@2x.png" alt="A few tests failed!" width="1024" height="960">

Darn, there were a couple of failing tests! At the same time, it's great that we were made aware of the potential problems – yay, regression tests!

Looking at the failure messages, the problem appears to be that the store went to the wrong URLs when fetching data from the server, resulting in some 404 errors. Specifically:

- When building the `query('rental')` request, the resulted `url` in request options was `/rentals`, instead of `/api/rentals.json`.
- When building the `findRecord('rental', 'grand-old-mansion')` request, the resulted `url` in request options was `/rentals/grand-old-mansion`, instead of `/api/rentals/grand-old-mansion.json`.

Hm, okay, so we have to teach EmberData to fetch data from the correct location. But how does EmberData know how to fetch data from our server in the first place?

## Working with Request builders and Handlers

Let's start customizing the things that didn't work for us by default. Specifically:

- Our resource URLs have an extra `/api` _namespace_ prefix.
- Our resource URLs have a `.json` extension at the end.

The first thing we want to do is have our builder respect a configurable default host and/or namespace. Adding a namespace prefix happens to be pretty common across Ember apps, so EmberData provides a global config mechanism for host and namespace. Typically you will want to do this either in your store file or app file.

```js { data-filename="app/app.js" data-diff="+5,+6,+7,+8,+9" }
import Application from '@ember/application';
import Resolver from 'ember-resolver';
import loadInitializers from 'ember-load-initializers';
import config from 'super-rentals/config/environment';
import { setBuildURLConfig } from '@ember-data/request-utils';

setBuildURLConfig({
  namespace: 'api',
});

export default class App extends Application {
  modulePrefix = config.modulePrefix;
  podModulePrefix = config.podModulePrefix;
  Resolver = Resolver;
}

loadInitializers(App, config.modulePrefix);
```

Adding the `.json` extension is a bit less common, and doesn't have a declarative configuration API of its own. We could just modify request options directly in place of use, but that would be a bit messy. Instead, let's create a handler to do this for us.

```js { data-filename="app/utils/handlers.js" }
export const JsonSuffixHandler = {
  request(context, next) {
    const { request } = context;
    const updatedRequest = Object.assign({}, request, {
      url: request.url + '.json',
    });

    return next(updatedRequest);
  },
};
```

As you can see, the handler appends `.json` to the URL of each request. Pretty simple, right? Then it calls the `next` function with the modified copy of the request object (because it is immutable). This is how we can chain multiple handlers together to build up a request.

The next step that we need to do, is to configure `RequestManager` to use this handler. Let's create the request-manager service.

```js { data-filename="app/services/request-manager.js" }
import BaseRequestManager from '@ember-data/request';
import Fetch from '@ember-data/request/fetch';
import { JsonSuffixHandler } from 'super-rentals/utils/handlers';

export default class RequestManager extends BaseRequestManager {
  constructor(args) {
    super(args);

    this.use([JsonSuffixHandler, Fetch]);
  }
}
```

Notice that we are using the `JsonSuffixHandler` we created earlier. We also use the `Fetch` handler, which is a built-in handler that makes the actual fetch request. The `use` method is used to add handlers to the request manager. The order in which handlers are added is important, as they will be executed in the order they were added.

Lastly, let's update our `store` service to use the new `RequestManager` we created.

```js { data-filename="app/services/store.js" data-diff="-1,+2,+3,+4,+5,+6,+7,+8" }
export { default } from 'ember-data/store';
// eslint-disable-next-line ember/use-ember-data-rfc-395-imports
import BaseStore from 'ember-data/store';
import { service } from '@ember/service';

export default class Store extends BaseStore {
  @service requestManager;
}
```

With our new EmberData configuration in place, all our tests should pass again.

The UI works exactly the same as before as well, just with much less code!

EmberData offers many, many features (like managing the _relationships_ between different models) and there's a lot more we can learn about it. For example, if your backend's have some inconsistencies across different endpoints, EmberData allows you to define request specific handlers and builders! We are just scratching the surface here. If you want to learn more about EmberData, check out [its own dedicated section](../../../models/) in the guides!
