Next, let's add the image for the rental property. We will use the component generator for this again.

```
ember generate component rental/image
```

This time, we had a slash in the component's name. This resulted in the component being created at `app/components/rental/image.hbs` instead of at the root of `app/components`. This component can be invoked as `<Rental::Image>`.

Components like these are known as *[namespaced](TODO: link to namespaced)* components. They allow us to organize our components by folders according to their purpose. This is completely optional â€“ namespaced components are not special in any way.

Let's edit the component's template:

```handlebars {data-filename="app/components/rental/image.hbs"}
<div class="image">
  <img ...attributes>
</div>
```

Instead of hard-coding specific `src` and `alt` attributes on the `<img>` tag, we opted for the `...attributes` keyword instead, which is also sometimes referred to as *["splattributes"](TODO: link to splattributes)* syntax. This allows arbitrary HTML attributes to be passed in when invoking this component:

```handlebars {data-filename="app/components/rental.hbs" data-diff="+2,+3,+4,+5,+6"}
<article class="rental">
  <Rental::Image
    src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Crane_estate_(5).jpg"
    alt="A picture of Grand Old Mansion"
  />

  <div class="details">
    <!-- ...snip... -->
  </div>
</article>
```

We specified a `src` and an `alt` HTML attribute here, which will be passed along to the component and attached to the element where `...attributes` is specified. You can think of this as being similar to `{{yield}}`, but for HTML attributes specifically, instead of for any content. In fact, we used this feature earlier when we passed a `class` attribute to `<LinkTo>`.

This way, our `<Rental::Image>` component is not coupled to any specific rental property on the site. Of course, the problem still exists, we simply moved it to the `<Rental>` component, but we will deal with that soon. We can try to limit all the hard-coding to the `<Rental>` component, so that we will have an easier time cleaning it up when we switch to fetching real data.

In general, it is a good idea to add `...attributes` to the primary element in your component. This will allow for maximum flexibility as the invoker may need to pass along classes for styling, or ARIA attributes to improve accessibility.

Let's write a test for our component!

<!-- TODO: format diff -->
```
import { module, test } from 'qunit';
import { setupRenderingTest } from 'ember-qunit';
import { render } from '@ember/test-helpers';
import hbs from 'htmlbars-inline-precompile';

 module('Integration | Component | rental/image', function(hooks) {
  setupRenderingTest(hooks);

  test('it renders the given image', async function(assert) {
    await render(hbs`
      <Rental::Image
        src="/assets/images/teaching-tomster.png"
        alt="Teaching Tomster"
      />
    `);

    assert.dom('.image').exists();
    assert.dom('.image img').hasAttribute('src', '/assets/images/teaching-tomster.png');
    assert.dom('.image img').hasAttribute('alt', 'Teaching Tomster');
  });
});
```

Finally, we should also update the tests for the `<Rental>` component to confirm that we successfully invoked `<Rental::Image>`.

<!-- TODO: format diff -->
```
import { module, test } from 'qunit';
import { setupRenderingTest } from 'ember-qunit';
import { render } from '@ember/test-helpers';
import hbs from 'htmlbars-inline-precompile';

module('Integration | Component | rental', function(hooks) {
  setupRenderingTest(hooks);

  test('it renders information about a rental property', async function(assert) {
    await render(hbs`<Rental />`);

    assert.dom('article').hasClass('rental');
    assert.dom('article h3').containsText('Grand Old Mansion');
    assert.dom('article .detail.owner').containsText('Veruca Salt');
    assert.dom('article .detail.type').containsText('Standalone');
    assert.dom('article .detail.location').containsText('San Francisco');
    assert.dom('article .detail.bedrooms').containsText('15');
    assert.dom('article .image').exists();
  });
});
```

Because we already tested `<Rental::Image>` extensively on its own, we can omit the details here and keep our assertion to the bare minimum. That way, we won't have to _also_ update the `<Rental>` tests whenever we make any changes to `<Rental::Image>`.
