Let's clean up our template before moving on. We introduced a lot of duplication when we added the conditional in the template. If we look closely, the only thing that is different between the two blocks are:

1. The presence of the `"large"` CSS class on the `<button>` tag.
2. The "View Larger"/"View Smaller" text.

These changes are buried deep within the large amount of duplicated
code. We can reduce the duplication by using `{{if}}` *[expression](TODO: link to expression)* instead:

```hbs {data-filename="app/components/rental/image.hbs"}
<button type="button" class="image {{if this.isLarge "large"}}" {{on "click" this.toggleSize}}>
  <img ...attributes>
  {{#if this.isLarge}}
    <small>View Smaller</small>
  {{else}}
    <small>View Larger</small>
  {{/if}}
</button>
```

The expression version of `{{if}}` takes two arguments. The first argument is the *[condition](TODO: link to condition)*. The second argument is the expression that should be evaluated if the condition is true.

Optionally, `{{if}}` can also take a third argument for what the expression should evaluate into if the condition is false. This means we could also rewrite the button label like so:

```hbs {data-filename="app/components/rental/image.hbs"}
<button type="button" class="image {{if this.isLarge "large"}}" {{on "click" this.toggleSize}}>
  <img ...attributes>
  <small>View {{if this.isLarge "Smaller" "Larger"}}</small>
</button>
```

Whether or not this is an improvement in the clarity of our code is mostly a matter of taste. Either way, we have significantly reduced the duplication in our code, and made the important bits of logic stand out from the rest.

If we run the test suite we should be able to confirm that everything is still working as expected. Great!
