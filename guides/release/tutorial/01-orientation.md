When you are done experimenting, go ahead and delete the `app/templates/application.hbs` file. We won't be needing this for a while, so let's start afresh. We can add it back later when we have a need for it.

If you still have your browser tab open, your tab should automatically reload into a blank page as you delete the file. This reflects the fact that we no longer have an application template in our app.

Create a `app/templates/index.hbs` file and paste the following markup.

```handlebars { data-filename="app/templates/index.hbs" }
<div class="jumbo">
  <div class="right tomster"></div>
  <h2>Welcome to Super Rentals!</h2>
  <p>We hope you find exactly what you're looking for in a place to stay.</p>
</div>
```

If you are thinking, "Hey, that looks like HTML!", then you would be right! In their simplest form, Ember templates are really just HTML. If you are already familiar with them, you should feel right at home here.

Of course, unlike HTML, Ember templates can do a lot more than just displaying static content. We will see that in action soon.

After saving the file, your browser tab should automatically refresh, showing us the welcome message we just worked on.

Before we do anything else, let's add some styling to our app. We spend enough time staring at the computer screen as it is, we must protect our eyesight against unstyled markup!

Fortunately, our designer sent us some CSS for us to use, so we can just go ahead <a href="/downloads/style.css" download="app.css">download the stylesheet file</a> and copy it into `app/styles/app.css`. This file has all the styles we need for building the rest of the app.

```css { data-filename="app/styles/app.css" }
@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,300italic,400,700,700italic);

/**
 * Base Elements
 */

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

body,
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6,
p,
div,
span,
a,
button {
  font-family: 'Lato', 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.5;
}

body {
  background: #f3f3f3;
}

/* ...snip... */
```

If you are familiar with CSS, feel free to customize them to your liking! Just keep in mind that you may see some visual differences going forward, if you choose to do so.

When you are ready, save the CSS file; our trusty development server should pick it up and refresh our page right away. No more unstyled content!

<img src="/screenshots/01-orientation/styled@2x.png" alt="Welcome to Super Rentals! (styled)" width="1024" height="256">

To match mockup from our designer, we will also need to download the `teaching-tomster.png` image, which was referenced from our CSS file:

```css { data-filename=app/styles/app.css }
.tomster {
  background: url(../assets/images/teaching-tomster.png);
  /* ...snip... */
}
```

As we learned earlier, the Ember convention is to place your source code in the `app` folder. For other assets like images and fonts, the convention is to put them in the `public` folder. We will follow this convention by <a href="/downloads/teaching-tomster.png" download="teaching-tomster.png">downloading the image file</a> and saving it into `public/assets/images/teaching-tomster.png`.

Both Ember CLI and the development server understand these folder conventions and will automatically make these files available to the browser.

You can confirm this by navigating to
`http://localhost:4200/assets/images/teaching-tomster.png`. The image should also show up in the welcome page we have been working on. You may need to do a manual refresh for the browser to pick up the new file.
