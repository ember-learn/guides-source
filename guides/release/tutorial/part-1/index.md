Welcome to the Ember Tutorial!

In this tutorial, we will use Ember to build an application called Super Rentals. This will be a website for browsing interesting places to stay during your next vacation. Check out the [finished app](https://ember-super-rentals.netlify.com) to get a sense of the scope of the project.

Along the way, you will learn everything you need to know to build a basic Ember application. If you get stuck at any point during the tutorial, feel free to download <https://github.com/ember-learn/super-rentals/tree/super-rentals-tutorial-output> for a complete working example.

This tutorial is structured into two parts. The first part covers the following basic concepts:

- Using Ember CLI
- Navigating the file and folder structure of an Ember app
- Building and linking between pages
- Templates and components
- Automated testing
- Working with server data

The second part of the tutorial builds upon these concepts and takes things to the next level.

Let's dive right in!
