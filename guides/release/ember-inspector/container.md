Every Ember application has a container that maintains object instances for you. You can
inspect these instances using the Container tab. This is useful for objects
that don't fall under a dedicated menu, such as services.

Click on the Container tab, and you will see a list of instances the container is holding. Click on a type to see the list of all instances of that type maintained by the container.

### Inspecting Instances

Click on a row to inspect a given instance using the Object Inspector.
