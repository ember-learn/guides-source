Editions are a new concept that were recently introduced to Ember. An edition
represents a cohesive programming model, and releasing a new edition represents
a _shift_ in the programming model due to new features and concepts being added
to Ember. Ember Octane is the first new edition that was added to Ember, and
this guide covers upgrading your application to use the new concepts introduced
by Octane.

## What is Ember Octane?

Ember Octane is a new _edition_ of Ember, packaging up all the work we've done
over the past few years to improve productivity and performance into a cohesive
whole.

Does this mean that Ember is moving back to "big bang" releases? Not at all.
We're still big believers in incremental improvements that move our community
forward together. You should think of editions as a refinement of the
incremental model, not a replacement.

Before we talk about more editions, let's quickly define a term that gets thrown
around a lot in these discussions: "the programming model."

Applied to Ember, this phrase refers to the idiomatic set of abstractions an
Ember developer uses to build web applications. These abstractions (and the
mental models that go with them) are designed to work together synergistically.
When combined as intended, they should yield code that is fast, consistent, and
maintainable.

Concretely, "Ember's programming model" encompasses how components, templates,
helpers, services, controllers, actions, etc. behave and interact, and how they
should be used in combination to solve common problems.

As we improve our collective understanding of web application architecture, we
sometimes need to change the programming model. Usually these are small tweaks,
but occasionally even the most foundational abstractions need to change. Perhaps
the best example of this is the shift from two-way bindings in Ember 1.x to the
"Data Down, Actions Up" unidirectional data flow of the Ember 2.x era. This
change touched almost every facet of how we build Ember apps.

Ember uses release channels and Semantic Versioning to communicate stability. As
soon as a new API lands in a stable release, it's safe to adopt, in the sense
that we have committed to not making any breaking changes.

Sometimes, though, we introduce new APIs to support a change to the programming
model. Often the new feature isn't very useful until it can be used in
conjunction with other new APIs that haven't landed yet.

Advanced users may try to adopt this new API right away and run into painful
edge cases inter-operating with the older programming model. Even worse, without
the bigger picture, it's easy for people to feel like core teams are
prioritizing unimportant features, or making changes for changes' sake.

Editions are intended to mitigate these problems by give a clear signal to the
community about programming model changes. The build up towards a new edition
helps us put new features in context, ensure APIs work together cohesively, and
update our documentation and marketing material.

The release of an edition signals to users that it's a good time to start
adopting new features, and they'll have a good experience because guides and
other documentation have been updated to put all of these changes into context.

One way we think about editions is their relationship to the "coherence" of
Ember. Over time, we incrementally introduce new APIs that work differently than
previous APIs. As we do this, we say Ember becomes less coherent, because not
everything needed to fully adopt the new programming model has landed yet.

![Coherence example chart](/images/upgrading/editions/coherence-chart.png)

Over time, we land more and more related APIs while deprecating APIs that arenâ€™t
aligned with the new model. As this happens, we say the framework becomes more
coherent.

Editions, then, are regular snapshots of the framework at its most coherent,
when everything needed to adopt the new programming model is in place.

Weâ€™ll be ironing out this process with our first edition, Ember Octane.
Hopefully this edition serves to tie together the many initiatives that weâ€™ve
worked on over the past few years, and helps show the world that Ember remains a
modern, competitive framework for getting things done.

## Features overview

The emphasis of Ember Octane is modern performance and productivity. To
accomplish that, weâ€™re cutting away cruft that is no longer needed while
introducing new features that make app development simpler and faster.

Hereâ€™s are some of the core features in Octane:

- **Native JavaScript classes**, unlocking simpler syntax, faster performance,
  and better interop with the wider ecosystem.
- **Decorators** for customizing the behavior of components and other classes.
- **Tracked properties**, a type of decorator that simplifies keeping the DOM
  up-to-date with JavaScript changes.
- **Async functions** (`async`/`await`) for authoring asynchronous code.
- **Native JavaScript modules**, including
  - **Distributing Ember as npm packages**.
  - **Importing npm packages** with zero additional configuration.
  - **Treeshaking** to eliminate unused dependencies from the final output.
- **Octane-style components**, including
  - **"Outer HTML" templates** that support fragments and easily customizing the
    root element.
  - **Customizable DOM attributes** with `...attributes`.
  - **`<AngleBracket>` syntax** for better readability.
- **Modernized file system layout** based on the Module Unification design.

Just as important is what weâ€™re removing from the Ember experience. These
features below will keep working, but you wonâ€™t have to use them if you donâ€™t
want to:

- **jQuery**. For DOM interaction, developers should use templates or native DOM
  APIs.
- **Non-native classes**. Octane apps say goodbye to `extend()`, `create()`, and
  mixins.
- **Computed properties and observers**, and other legacy features of the Ember
  object model.
- **Curly component invocation**, eliminating the ambiguity in templates between
  values and DOM creation.
- **The runloop**. App developers should never have to write code that interacts
  with the Ember runloop, even in tests.
- **Ember "inner HTML" components**, and the confusing JavaScript API used to
  configure a componentâ€™s root element, like `tagName`, `classNameBindings`,
  etc.

Note that these features will continue to work for apps that need them. An
edition is not a breaking change, just a minor release. But for someone starting
a new Ember app today, this is complexity they can safely skip learning.

## Creating a New App

To take Octane for a spin, you can try the preview blueprint:

```sh
ember new octane-app -b @ember/octane
```

Once Octane is released, the default blueprint will be updated to reflect the
Octane defaults and specifying this blueprint will no longer be necessary.

### File Layout

TODO

### Templates

There are three major changes to templates in Octane:

1. Angle Bracket Syntax
2. Named Arguments
3. Required `this`

#### Angle Bracket Syntax

Angle bracket syntax is a new way to invoke components that is much easier to
read, helps distinguish between helper logic and components, and has other
benefits:

```hbs
<!-- Before -->
{{#todo-list as |item|}}
  {{to-do item=item}}
{{/todo-list}}

<!-- After -->
<TodoList as |item|>
  <Todo @item={{item}}/>
</TodoList>
```

As you can see, they use angle brackets instead of double curly brackets when
invoked, thus the name. This allows them to match up much more closely with
HTML - as you can see from looking at the "after" example above, components open
and close in the same way as HTML elements, and self closing components require
a trailing slash just like `<img/>` or other tags.

They also have a number of other differences and benefits:

- Must use the `CapitalCase` form of the component name, instead of the
  `kebab-case` form.
- Single word component names are completely OK in angle bracket form!

  ```hbs
  <!-- throws an error ðŸ›‘ -->
  {{todo}}

  <!-- works! âœ… -->
  <Todo/>
  ```

- Standard attribute values applied to the component are treated like _plain-old
  HTML attributes_. This means you can assign any valid HTML attribute, and it
  will be reflected onto the component directly:

  ```hbs
    <Todo
      role="list-item"
      data-test-todo-item
      data-test-id={{this.todo.id}}
      class="todo {{this.todoClass}}"
    />
  ```

  As you can see, both literal and bound values can be set on attributes, and
  attributes can be used _without_ setting a value at all, just like HTML
  attributes. The component decides where to put these attributes with the
  special `...attributes` syntax. This will be discussed later in the section on
  Glimmer components. For classic components, attributes are placed on the
  component's wrapper element.

- _Arguments_ are passed by adding `@` to the front of the argument name:

  ```hbs
  <!-- Before -->
  {{todo item=item}}

  <!-- After -->
  <Todo @item={{item}}/>
  ```

  Like with attributes, both literal values and bound values can be passed to an
  argument. It's important to note that if you want to pass a primitive literal
  value to an argument, it must be wrapped in double curlies:

  ```hbs
  <Todo @done={{false}}/>
  ```

  This is necessary because, like HTML, all values that are passed to attributes
  and arguments which are not wrapped as strings are coerced into strings.

  In classic components, arguments passed this way will still be assigned to the
  instance just like normal. The behavior of arguments in Glimmer components
  will be discussed later one.

- Yielded values work the same as in curly invocation:

  ```hbs
  <TodoList as |item|>
    <Todo @item={{item}}/>
  </TodoList>
  ```

- Yielded components can also be invoked with angle bracket syntax:

  ```hbs
  <TodoList as |Item|>
    <Item/>
  </TodoList>
  ```

- Positional arguments are _not_ available in angle bracket invocation, since
  there is some abiguity between their behavior and the behavior of standard
  HTML attributes (HTML attributes without `=` default to truthy). If you still
  need positional arguments, you _must_ use the component with curly bracket
  syntax.

Angle bracket syntax works with both classic components and Glimmer components,
so you can update your templates incrementally, independently from updating the
components themselves. It is also not a _requirement_, curly invocation
continues to work with classic components and Glimmer components, but it is
highly recommended in general.

#### Named Arguments

Named arguments are a new syntax that allows you to refer to the arguments of a
component _directly_ within your template:

```hbs {data-filename=application.hbs}
<BlogPost @title="Hello, world!"/>
```

```hbs {data-filename=blog-post.hbs}
<h1>{{@title}}</h1>
```

As you can see, named arguments are prefixed with the `@` symbol, which mirrors
the argument being passed into a component via angle bracket invocation, making
it easier to remember and connect the two! However, you can still refer to
argument values if the component was invoked using curly bracket syntax:

```hbs {data-filename=application.hbs}
{{blog-post title="Hello, world!"}}
```

```hbs {data-filename=blog-post.hbs}
<!-- This still works -->
<h1>{{@title}}</h1>
```

This means you can safely refactor your components to use named argument syntax
without having to worry about every single _use_ of your component being updated
to angle bracket syntax.

Another very important thing to know about named argument syntax is that it
_always_ refers to the _original_ value of the argument. If you change that
value in a classic component, it will _not_ update:

```js {data-filename=blog-post.js}
export default Component.extend({
  init() {
    this.set('title', this.title.toUpperCase());
  },
});
```

```hbs {data-filename=blog-post.hbs}
<!-- This is the original title, "Hello, world!" -->
<h1>{{@title}}</h1>

<!-- This is the uppercased title, "HELLO, WORLD!" -->
<h1>{{this.title}}</h1>
```

This means that you can know by looking at the template whether or not a value
was ever mutated by the component's class, if it even exists, or if it is
directly from the external context. If you need to provide a default value,
you'll have to do it via a getter or by using a helper in the template:

```hbs {data-filename=blog-post.hbs}
<!-- using {{or}} from ember-truth-helpers -->
<h1>{{or @title "Untitled"}}</h1>
```

#### Required `this`

Finally, one thing you may have noticed in the above examples is a lot more
references to `this` in the template. This is a new requirement for any values
that are rendered from the local context (e.g. the component or controller
instance that backs the template).

```hbs
<!-- Before -->
{{title}}

<!-- After -->
{{this.title}}
```

Template fallback behavior, where a name without `this` would fallback to
looking up the value on that context, has been deprecated, and will be removed
in future versions.

The reason for this change is to provide extra clarity to both users reading
templates, and the compiler. Without explicitly referring to `this`, a lot of
handlebars statements are pretty ambiguous - for instance, `{{title}}` could be
a helper, a local variable, or a component property.

Note that this only applies to component/controller properties. Local variables,
introduced via a yield, can still be refered to directly since they're
unambiguous:

```hbs
{{#let "Title" as |title|}}
  <!-- This works, because it's a local variable and unambiguous -->
  {{title}}
{{/let}}
```

And that wraps up the major template changes! Now, let's move on to native class
syntax!

### Native Classes

Native classes are officially supported in Ember Octane for use with:

- Glimmer Components
- Ember Data Models
- Routes
- Controllers
- Services
- Helpers
- General utility classes

The only class that is _not_ supported is the _classic Ember component_ class,
imported from `@ember/component`. This is mainly because it requires additional
decorators that are not available in Ember.js directly. You can instead use
external addons like [ember-decorators][1] if you want to convert these to
native classes, and refer to their documentation as a guide. This guide will
cover usage of native classes with the other constructs, and the major
differences between them and classic classes.

[1]: https://ember-decorators.github.io/ember-decorators

#### `constructor` instead of `init`

When using native classes, you should use `constructor` instead of the `init`
function:

```js
// Before
import Controller from '@ember/controller';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';

export default Controller.extend({
  store: service(),

  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);

    this.featureFlags = this.store.findAll('feature-flag');
  },
});
```

```js
// After
import Controller from '@ember/controller';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';

export default class ApplicationController extends Controller {
  @service store;

  constructor() {
    super(...arguments);

    this.featureFlags = this.store.findAll('feature-flag');
  }
}
```

It's important to note that only _explicit_ injections are available during
class construction (e.g. injections added using `@service`). If you still rely
on _implicit_ injections, like Ember Data automatically injecting the `store`
service, you will need to add it explicitly instead:

```js
import Controller from '@ember/controller';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';

export default class ApplicationController extends Controller {
  constructor() {
    super(...arguments);

    this.featureFlags = this.store.findAll('feature-flag');
    // Error: store is undefined, so this will break
  }
}
```

Adding explicit injections in general is a highly recommended practice.

#### Fields vs. Properties

Native classes have _fields_ instead of properties:

```js
// Before
import Controller from '@ember/controller';

export default Controller.extend({
  title: 'hello-world.app',
});
```

```js
// After
import Controller from '@ember/controller';

export default class ApplicationController extends Controller {
  title = 'hello-world.app';
}
```

Fields are syntactic sugar for assigning the value in the constructor, like so:

```js
import Controller from '@ember/controller';

export default class ApplicationController extends Controller {
  constructor() {
    super(...arguments);
    this.title = 'hello-world.app';
  }
}
```

This means that the field created is assigned for every _instance_, instead of
once on the prototype like properties. This has two important implications:

1. It is now _safe_ to assign objects to fields! You can assign an array or an
   object to your field, and it won't be shared between instances of the class:

   ```js
   import Component from '@glimmer/component';

   export default class ShoppingList extends Component {
     // This is completely ok!
     items = ['milk', 'potatoes'];
   }
   ```

2. Performance can be a concern with fields, since they eagerly create new
   values for _every_ instance of the component. This is generally not a
   problem, but is something to be aware of.

Other than that, fields can generally replace properties in every case.

#### Getters and Setters

Getters and setters can be defined directly on native classes:

```js
export default class Person {
  firstName = 'Katie';
  lastName = 'Gengler';

  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
}
```

It's important to note that these are _not_ the same as computed properties,
they don't have caching by default or have dependencies, and they rerun
everytime they are used. In order to have getters and setters _rerender_ when
values have changed, you must either decorate them with the `@computed`
decorator, or use _tracked properties_.

Classic classes didn't have an equivalent for native getters and setters until
recently, but you can define them now with the `descriptor` decorator:

```js
export default EmberObject.extend({
  firstName: 'Katie',
  lastName: 'Gengler',

  fullName: descriptor({
    get() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    },
  }),
});
```

#### Decorators

Decorators are a new concept in _JavaScript_, but if you've never seen them
before, don't worry, they've been used in Ember for _years_. `computed()` is in
fact a type of decorator:

```js
import EmberObject, { computed } from '@ember/object';

export default EmberObject.extend({
  firstName: 'Katie',
  lastName: 'Gengler',

  fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', {
    get() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    },
  }),
});
```

The native decorator version functions the same, just with a slightly different
syntax:

```js
import { computed } from '@ember/object';

export default class Person {
  firstName = 'Katie';
  lastName = 'Gengler';

  @computed('firstName', 'lastName')
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
}
```

Notice that you don't need to pass in the `get` function to the decorator
itself. Instead, the decorator gets _applied_ to a getter function, modifying it
in place. Existing computed properties and computed property macros, including
custom ones you've defined, can be used with this new syntax:

```js
import { computed } from '@ember/object';
import { alias } from '@ember/object/computed';

function join(...keys) {
  return computed(...keys, {
    get() {
      return keys.map(key => this[key]).join(' ');
    },
  });
}

// Before
const ClassicPerson = EmberObject.extend({
  firstName: 'Katie',
  lastName: 'Gengler',

  fullName: join('firstName', 'lastName'),
  name: alias('fullName'),
});

// After
class Person {
  firstName = 'Katie';
  lastName = 'Gengler';

  @join('firstName', 'lastName') fullName;
  @alias('fullName') name;
}
```

Other decorators exist, including `@tracked` which will be discussed later on,
and the `@action` decorator. The `@action` decorator replaces the `actions` hash
on routes, controllers, and components:

```js
// Before
import Controller from '@ember/controller';

export default Controller.extend({
  actions: {
    helloWorld() {
      console.log('Hello, world!');
    },
  },
});
```

```js
// After
import Controller from '@ember/controller';

export default class ApplicationController extends Controller {
  @action
  helloWorld() {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
  }
}
```

The action decorator also _binds_ actions, so you can refer to them directly in
templates without the `{{action}}` helper anymore:

```hbs
<!-- Before -->
<button onclick={{action 'helloWorld'}}></button>
```

```hbs
<!-- After -->
<button onclick={{this.helloWorld}}></button>
```

You should still use the `{{action}}` helper if you need to pass additional
parameters to the action though:

```hbs
<button onclick={{action this.helloWorld "some" "values"}}></button>
```

#### `super`

In native classes, there is a dedicated `super` keyword that replaces the
`_super()` method:

```js
// Before
const Person = EmberObject.extend();

const Firefighter = Person.extend({
  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);
    this.firstName = 'Rob';
    this.lastName = 'Jackson';
  }

  saveKitten() {
    this._super(...arguments);
    console.log('kitten saved!');
  }
});

// After
class Person {}

class Firefighter extends Person {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.firstName = 'Rob';
    this.lastName = 'Jackson';
  }

  saveKitten() {
    if (super.saveKitten) {
      super.saveKitten(...arguments);
    }

    console.log('kitten saved!');
  }
}
```

As you can see, it functions a little bit differently that the `_super()`
method. When used in a constructor, you call it directly like a function. You
_must_ do this before using `this` in the constructor, otherwise it's a syntax
error. However, when used in any other method, you must _explicitly_ specify
the function you are calling on the parent class.

Another difference is that unlike `_super()`, if the method doesn't exist on the
parent class then an error will be thrown. In most cases, the method should
exist or not, and you shouldn't need to guard it one way or the other.

#### `static`

In classic classes, if you wanted to add values to the _class_ itself, you had
to use the `reopenClass` method:

```js
const Vehicle = EmberObject.extend({
  init() {
    this._super();
    this.id = Vehicle.count;
    Vehicle.incrementCount();
  },
});

Vehicle.reopenClass({
  count: 0,
  incrementCount() {
    this.count++;
  },
});
```

In native classes this can be done with the `static` keyword instead:

```js
class Vehicle {
  constructor() {
    this.id = Vehicle.count;
    Vehicle.incrementCount();
  }

  static count = 0;
  static incrementCount() {
    this.count++;
  }
}
```

The `static` keyword can be applied to all class elements.

### Tracked Properties

Tracked properties are a new way to track changes to state in Ember Octane,
replacing computed properties (CPs). Unlike CPs, which require you to annotate
every getter with the values it depends on, tracked properties only require to
annotate the values that are _trackable_, that is values that:

1. Change over time and
2. May cause the DOM to update in response to those changes

For example, a computed property like this:

```js
import EmberObject, { computed } from '@ember/object';

const Person = EmberObject.extend({
  fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }),
});
```

Could be rewritten as:

```js
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';

class Person {
  @tracked firstName;
  @tracked lastName;

  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
}
```

Notice how `fullName` doesn't require _any_ annotation at all - it's a plain old
native getter, and it'll still work and invalidate if it's used anywhere in a
template, directly or indirectly.

An additional benefit is that you no longer have to use `set` to update these
values, you can use standard JavaScript syntax instead!

```js
// Before
let chad = Person.create();
chad.set('firstName', 'Chad');
chad.set('lastName', 'Hietala');
```

```js
// After
let chad = new Person();
chad.firstName = 'Chad';
chad.lastName = 'Hietala';
```

`@tracked` installs a native setter that tracks updates to these properties,
allowing you to treat them like any other JS value.

Tracked properties have subtler benefits as well:

- They enforce that all of the trackable properties in your classes are
  annotated, making them easy to find. With computed properties, it was common
  to have properties be "implicit" in a class definition, like in the example
  above; the classic class version of `Person` doesn't have `firstName` and
  `lastName` properties defined, but they are _implied_ by their existence as
  dependencies in the `fullName` CP.
- They enforce a "public API" of all values that are trackable in your class.
  With CPs, it was possible to watch _any_ value in a class for changes, and
  there was nothing you as the class author could do about it. With tracked
  properties, only the values you _want_ to be trackable will trigger updates
  to anything external to your class.

Most computed properties should be fairly straightforward to convert to tracked
properties. It's important to note that in _Glimmer components_, arguments are
automatically tracked, but in classic components they are _not_. This is because
arguments are put on the `args` hash on Glimmer components, which is tracked
property. Since they are assigned to arbitrary properties on classic components,
they can't be instrumented ahead of time, so you must decorate them manually.

#### Plain Old JavaScript Objects (POJOs)

It's not uncommon to use POJOs in Ember code for storing state, representing
some models, etc. This works because `get` and `set` can be used for any path,
on any object, whether or not its an `EmberObject`, and whether or not the
property was declared in advance. This is part of what lead to the "implicit"
property problem - you `set` any property you wanted on a existing object and it
would work.

With tracked properties this is _not_ possible, since each property must be
instrumented ahead of time, and decorators can only be applied in classes. In
general, the recommendation here to convert usages of POJOs to native classes
wherever possible:

```js
// Before
import EmberObject, { computed } from '@ember/object';

const Person = EmberObject.extend({
  init() {
    this.address = {};
  },

  fullAddress: computed('address.{street,city,region,country}', function() {
    let { street, city, region, country } = this.address;

    return `${street}, ${city}, ${state}, ${country}`;
  }),
});
```

```js
// After
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';

class Address {
  @tracked street;
  @tracked city;
  @tracked region;
  @tracked country;
}

class Person {
  address = new Address();

  get fullAddress() {
    let { street, city, region, country } = this.address;

    return `${street}, ${city}, ${state}, ${country}`;
  }
}
```

In some cases, if your usage of properties on POJOs is too dynamic, you may not
be able to enumerate every single property that could be tracked. There could be
a prohibitive number of possible properties, or there could be no way to know
them in advance. In this case, it's recommended that you _reset_ the value
wherever it is updated:

```js
class SimpleCache {
  @tracked _cache = {};

  set(key, value) {
    this._cache[key] = value;

    // trigger an update
    this._cache = this._cache;
  }

  get(key) {
    return this._cache(key);
  }
}
```

Triggering an update like this will cause any getters that used the `cache` to
recalculate. Note that we can use the `get` method to access the cache, and it
will still push the `_cache` tracked property.

#### Arrays

Arrays are another example of a type of object where you can't enumerate every
possible value - after all, there are an infinite number of integers (though you
_may_ run out of bits in your computer at some point!) Like with POJOs with
dynamic keys, it is recommended that you _reset_ the array after changing it in
order to trigger changes:

```js
class ShoppingList {
  @tracked items = [];

  addItem(item) {
    this.items.push(item);

    // trigger an update
    this.items = this.items;
  }
}
```

### Data Down, Actions Up: A Single Owner for Every Object

The pattern of resetting a POJO or array may seem pretty strange, and may be
difficult to refactor to in some applications. After all, it's possible that the
array or object is referenced in multiple places. Does this mean you have to
reset it in _all_ of those locations in order for it to update properly? That
would quickly become a maintenance nightmare!

In order to make tracked properties work effectively, you must follow the
_single owner_ principle - every piece of state, every object or array, should
have a _single_, canonical "owner". This could be a component, or a controller,
or a service - but ultimately, this will be the object that owns and updates
that state, and all other values should _derive_ from that state via getters,
component arguments, or other _trackable_ means.

This is what is meant by the Data Down, Actions Up pattern. The data should flow
downward, along with _actions_ that can be used to update the data. For
instance, you might have an array of people in a controller, and an action which
updates those people:

```js
import Controller from '@ember/controller';
import { action } from '@ember/object';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';

export default class ApplicationController extends Controller {
  people = [];

  @action
  addPerson(person) {
    this.people.push(person);
    this.people = this.people;
  }
}
```

And you could pass this downward into components for use:

```hbs
<ul>
  {{#each this.people as |person|}}
    <li>{{person.name}}</li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>

<CreatePersonForm @addPerson={{this.addPerson}}/>
```

Following this pattern means that by updating the value in the owner object, you
can be sure that everywhere that the value is used will be updated as well. It
_also_ means that you centralize all mutations to your state in a single
location, which prevents your code from becoming a twisted tangled mess!

#### Backwards Compatibility

Tracked properties are fully backwards compatible with CPs and `get`/`set`. CPs
that use tracked properties will automatically update without any need to add
them to the dependencies:

```js
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
import { computed } from '@ember/object';

class Person {
  @tracked firstName;

  @computed('lastName')
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
}
```

And vice-versa, computed properties used in native getters will update
correctly:

```js
class Person {
  @computed('firstName', 'lastName')
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }

  get helloMessage() {
    return `${this.fullName} says hello!`;
  }
}
```

Likewise, properties that you get using `get` will update later on when you use
`set` to update them:

```js
class Person {
  get fullName() {
    let firstName = get(this, 'firstName');
    let lastName = get(this, 'lastName');

    return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
  }
}

let kris = new Person();
set(kris, 'firstName', 'Kris');
set(kris, 'lastName', 'Selden');
```

However, you _must_ use `get` for these properties, since they are not tracked
and there is no way to know in advance that they might be changed with `set`.

Additionally, certain Ember objects still require the use of `get` and `set`,
such as `ObjectProxy` and `ArrayProxy`. These will continue to function with
tracked, but you _must_ use `get` and `set`. Likewise, KVO functions on Ember's
`Enumerable` class and the various implementations of it will _generally_
continue to be tracked.

If you have implemented your own version of an Ember `Enumerable`, or the
`EmberArray` mixin, in general, you will need to add an additional step to your
implementation of `objectAt` in order for it to work with tracking:

```js
objectAt() {
  get(this, '[]');

  // your implementation
}
```

This will push the tag for the `[]` property onto the autotrack stack, and that
property is what is invalidated when the array is updated with KVO methods.

### Glimmer Components

Glimmer components are Ember's new component API in Octane. They have a number
of benefits (including compatibility with Glimmer.js) but for this guide we'll
be focusing on the differences between them and classic components, and how you
can update your classic components to them.

Glimmer components _require_ native class syntax, you can't define them with
classic classes. You can define a Glimmer component like this:

```js
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';

export default class Todo extends Component {
  @tracked completed;
}
```

Glimmer components don't extend from `EmberObject` at all, which means that they
don't have any of the standard `EmberObject` APIs, such as `reopenClass`,
`extend`, and they do _not_ support Ember mixins. It also means you can safely
use `constructor` for all setup code.

#### Lifecycle and Properties

Glimmer components have exactly 2 lifecycle hooks:

- `constructor`
- `willDestroy`

These can be used to setup the class and tear it down, respectively. Other
lifecycle hooks, like `didInsertElement` and `didUpdate` don't have equivalents
in Glimmer components. Instead, you should use _modifiers_ to fill their use
cases. These are discussed in more detail later on.

Glimmer components also have 3 properties:

- `args` - the arguments that the component receives when invoked. These are
  passed to and assigned in the constructor, so they're available then for any
  setup code that is needed.
- `isDestroying` - Set to true when the component has been marked for
  destruction.
- `isDestroyed` - Set to true when the component has been fully destroyed.

#### Outer HTML

Glimmer components don't have a wrapping element. This is referred to as _outer
HTML semantics_, and it means that whatever you see in the template is what you
get in the final rendered DOM:

```hbs
<!-- template.hbs -->
<div>
  Hello, {{this.worldName}}!
</div>
```

```html
<!-- rendered -->
<div>
  Hello, Earth!
</div>
```

This means that you no longer have to customize your component using any of the
following APIs:

- `tagName`
- `classNames`
- `classNameBindings`
- `attributeBindings`

Instead, you can do these directly in your template. Here are some before and
after examples of each API, converted from classic components to Glimmer
components:

- `tagName`

  Before:

  ```js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default Component.extend({
    tagName: 'button',
    text: 'Hello, world!',

    click() {
      console.log('Hello, world!');
    },
  });
  ```

  ```hbs
  {{this.text}}
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';
  import { action } from '@ember/object';

  export default class HelloButton extends Component {
    text = 'Hello, world!';

    @action
    sayHello() {
      console.log('Hello, world!');
    }
  }
  ```

  ```hbs
  <button onclick={{this.sayHello}}>
    {{this.text}}
  </button>
  ```

- `classNames`

  Before:

  ```js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default Component.extend({
    classNames: ['hello-world'],
    text: 'Hello, world!',
  });
  ```

  ```hbs
  {{this.text}}
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';

  export default class Hello extends Component {
    text = 'Hello, world!';
  }
  ```

  ```hbs
  <div class="hello-world">
    {{this.text}}
  </div>
  ```

- `classNameBindings`

  Before:

  ```js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default Component.extend({
    classNameBindings: ['darkMode:dark-mode'],
    darkMode: false,
    text: 'Hello, world!',
  });
  ```

  ```hbs
  {{this.text}}
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';

  export default class Hello extends Component {
    text = 'Hello, world!';
    darkMode = false;
  }
  ```

  ```hbs
  <div class="{{if this.darkMode 'dark-mode'}}">
    {{this.text}}
  </div>
  ```

- `attributeBindings`

  Before:

  ```js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default Component.extend({
    attributeBindings: ['role'],
    role: 'button',
    text: 'Hello, world!',
  });
  ```

  ```hbs
  {{this.text}}
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';

  export default class Hello extends Component {
    text = 'Hello, world!';
    role = 'button';
  }
  ```

  ```hbs
  <div role={{this.role}}>
    {{this.text}}
  </div>
  ```

To sum it up, the new mental model is that the "wrapping" element is just like
any other element in your template, and you interact with it in exactly the same
way. This means that when converting a classic component to a Glimmer component,
you will need to add the wrapping element that was there previously to the
template (unless it was a tagless component, e.g. `tagName: ''`).

#### `...attributes`

When using angle-bracket invocation in classic components, all standard HTML
attributes (values not prefixed with `@`) get reflected onto the wrapping
element, with `class` being merged. In Glimmer components, there isn't
necessarily a wrapping element to apply these attributes to! Or there may be
_multiple_ wrapping elements:

```hbs
<!--
  This template is text only, the component doesn't have
  any wrapping elements!
-->
Hello, world!
```

```hbs
<!--
  This template has multiple top level elements, the h1
  and the p. Which one should we use?
-->
<h1>
  Hello, world!
</h1>
<p>
  Lorem Ipsum...
</p>
```

Glimmer components allow you to use the special `...attributes` syntax to the
elements you want to apply the attributes to:

```hbs
<!--
  The paragraph gets the attributes, and not the h1
-->
<h1>
  Hello, world!
</h1>
<p ...attributes>
  Lorem Ipsum...
</p>
```

Attributes can be applied to multiple elements as well:

```hbs
<!-- Both elements get the attributes -->
<h1 ...attributes>
  Hello, world!
</h1>
<p ...attributes>
  Lorem Ipsum...
</p>
```

Finally, if you don't apply `...attributes` to _any_ elements, then Ember will
throw an error if someone tries to use attributes when invoking your component.
This allows you to maintain control over the component if you want:

```hbs
<!-- components/uncustomizable-button.hbs -->
<button class="btn">Do a thing!</button>
```

```hbs
<!-- This throws an error -->
<UncustomizableButton class="customized-button-class"/>
```

Attributes are also available to classic components, but they pre-apply it to
the wrapper element. If you're converting a component from classic components
to Glimmer components, you should be sure to add `...attributes` to the wrapper
element.

Before:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';

export default Component.extend({
  text: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

```hbs
{{this.text}}
```

After:

```js
import Component from '@glimmer/component';

export default class Hello extends Component {
  text = 'Hello, world!';
}
```

```hbs
<div ...attributes>
  {{this.text}}
</div>
```

#### Arguments

In class components, arguments are assigned _directly_ to the class instance.
This has caused a lot of issues over the years, from methods and actions being
overwritten, to unclear code where the difference between internal class values
and arguments is hard to reason about.

Glimmer components solve this by placing all arguments in an object available
as the `args` property.

Before:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';
import { computed } from '@ember/object';

export default Component.extend({
  firstName: '',
  lastName: '',

  fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }),
});
```

```hbs
<!-- Usage -->
<Person @firstName="Kenneth" @lastName="Larsen" />
```

After:

```js
import Component from '@glimmer/component';

export default class Person extends Component {
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.args.firstName} ${this.args.lastName}`;
  }
}
```

```hbs
<!-- Usage -->
<Person @firstName="Kenneth" @lastName="Larsen" />
```

`args` and its values are automatically tracked, so there is no need to annotate
them, the `fullName` getter will invalidate properly when they change and the
component will rerender (if `fullName` is used in the template).

Additionally, `args` is _not_ mutable, and is frozen in development modes. This
is partially to prevent folks from trying to accomplish two-way bindings (which
doesn't work, this is discussed in more detail below) and partially to ensure
that `args` always stays in sync with the arguments passed to the component, so
it can be the canonical "single source of truth". If you want to provide
defaults to an argument, you should use a getter.

Before:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';
import { computed } from '@ember/object';

export default Component.extend({
  firstName: 'Kenneth',
  lastName: 'Larsen',

  fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }),
});
```

After:

```js
import Component from '@glimmer/component';

export default class Person extends Component {
  get firstName() {
    return this.args.firstName || 'Kenneth';
  }

  get lastName() {
    return this.args.lastName || 'Larsen';
  }

  get fullName() {
    return `${this.args.firstName} ${this.args.lastName}`;
  }
}
```

#### One-way Data Flow

Classic component's arguments are _two-way bound_. This means that when you
_set_ a value in the component, it also changes the value in the _parent_
component:

```js
// components/parent.js
import Component from '@ember/component';

export default Component.extend({
  value: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

```hbs
<!-- templates/components/parent.hbs -->
<Child @value={{this.value}} />
```

```js
// components/child.js
import Component from '@ember/component';

export default Component.extend({
  click() {
    this.set('value', 'Hello, moon!');
  },
});
```

```hbs
<!-- templates/components/child.hbs -->
<button>
  Change value
</button>
```

In this setup, when we click the child component's button, it'll update the
value in both the child component _and_ the parent component. This feature led
to many problematic data patterns in classic components, where mutations would
occur seemingly randomly. It was hard to figure out what was causing changes,
and to debug them.

In Glimmer components, arguments are _one-way bound_. There is no way to
directly mutate an value on a parent component from the child component, even if
it is passed as an argument. Instead, you must send an _action_ upward to mutate
the value:

```js
// components/parent.js
import Component from '@glimmer/component';

export default class Parent extends Component {
  value = 'Hello, world!';

  @action
  updateValue(newValue) {
    this.value = newValue;
  }
}
```

```hbs
<!-- templates/components/parent.hbs -->
<Child @value={{this.value}} @onClick={{this.updateValue}} />
```

```js
// components/child.js
import Component from '@ember/component';

export default class Child extends Component {}
```

```hbs
<!-- templates/components/child.hbs -->
<button onclick={{action @onClick 'Hello, moon!'}}>
  Change value
</button>
```

In our new setup, the parent component has an action which sets the new value.
We pass this action to the child component, and the child component directly
assigns it to the `onclick` of the button, using the `{{action}}` helper to pass
the value we want to call the `@onClick` action with. We don't need any
additional logic in the child class itself - in fact, this could become a
template-only component at this point.

This pattern is known as _Data-Down, Actions Up_, or _unidirectional data flow_.
With Glimmer components, this pattern is enforced - all mutations must occur
through actions. This clarifies the data flow, because it's immediately possible
to see where all of the mutations are occuring.

#### Lifecycle Hooks & Modifiers

As we mentioned above, Glimmer components only have two lifecycle hooks,
`constructor` and `willDestroy`. There were a number of other lifecycle hooks
that existed on classic components which were generally related to updating
component state or DOM manipulation:

- `willInsertElement`
- `didInsertElement`
- `willDestroyElement`
- `didDestroyElement`
- `willRender`
- `didRender`
- `willUpdate`
- `didUpdate`
- `didReceiveAttrs`
- `didUpdateAttrs`

These can generally be replaced either by using getters, in cases where they are
related to updating component state, or by using _modifiers_.

##### Updating component state

If you previously did something like this in your `didReceiveAttrs` or
`didUpdateAttrs` hooks:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';

export default Component.extend({
  didUpdateAttrs() {
    this._super(...arguments);

    if (this.disabled) {
      // clear input value
      this.set('value', '');
    }
  },

  @action
  updateValue(newValue) {
    this.set('value', newValue);

    if (this.onChange) {
      this.onChange(newValue);
    }
  },
});
```

You can instead model this through getters and setters, deriving the value from
the state of your component:

```js
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';

export default class Text extends Component {
  @tracked _value;

  get value() {
    if (this.args.disabled) {
      return (this._value = '');
    }

    return this._value;
  }

  @action
  updateValue(newValue) {
    this._value = newValue;

    if (this.args.onChange) {
      this.args.onChange(newValue);
    }
  }
}
```

You'll notice that this getter is _mutating_ the value when the Text copmonent
is disabled. If this feels like a code smell to you, it probably is, and is a
sign that we're managing state at the wrong level. In this case, for instance,
we should instead consider converting the text component to be a stateless
component, and mutate the value in the same place where the `disabled` is set:
The Parent component.

```js
// components/form.js
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';

export default class Form extends Component {
  @tracked text;
  @tracked disabled;

  @action
  updateText(text) {
    this.text = text;
  }

  @action
  updateDisabled(disabled) {
    this.disabled = disabled;

    if (disabled) {
      this.text = '';
    }
  }
}
```

```hbs
<!-- templates/components/form.hbs -->
<Text
  @value={{this.text}}
  @disabled={{this.disabled}}
  @onchange={{this.updateText}}
/>
<button onclick={{action this.updateDisabled (not this.disabled)}}>
  Toggle Disabled
</button>
```

```js
import Component from '@glimmer/component';

export default class Text extends Component {
  @action
  updateValue(newValue) {
    if (this.args.onChange) {
      this.args.onChange(newValue);
    }
  }
}
```

Now the Text component doesn't have any internal state, it defers to the parent
Form component, and when the Form component toggles its disabled state, it
clears the state of the text. The mutation of state is centralized in the action
where it occurs, making our program easier to reason about as a whole.

##### DOM Manipulation

In cases when you were using the hooks to manipulate the DOM, you can instead
update to use _modifiers_. For instance, let's say you were adding an event
listener to the `element` in your component's `didInsertElement` hook, and
removing it in `willDestroyElement`:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';

export default Component.extend({
  didInsertElement() {
    this._super(...arguments);

    this.listener = e => {
      this.set('scrollOffset', e.clientY);
    };

    this.element.addEventListener(`scroll`, this.listener);
  },

  willDestroyElement() {
    this.element.removeEventListener(`scroll`, this.listener);

    this._super(...arguments);
  },
});
```

This could be rewritten using the `{{did-insert}}` and `{{will-destroy}}`
modifiers from [ember-render-modifiers][2] in a Glimmer component:

[2]: https://github.com/emberjs/ember-render-modifiers

```js
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class ScrollComponent extends Component {
  @tracked scrollOffset;

  @action
  listener(e) {
    this.scrollOffset = e.clientY;
  }

  @action
  registerListener(element) {
    element.addEventListener('scroll', this.listener);
  }

  @action
  unregisterListener(element) {
    element.removeEventListener('scroll', this.listener);
  }
}
```

```hbs
<div
  {{did-insert this.registerListener}}
  {{will-destroy this.unregisterListener}}
>
  ...
</div>
```

These modifiers run the function passed to them when the _element_ they are
applied to is inserted into or removed from the DOM. This makes the hooks
explicit in the element they are acting on. There is also a `did-update`
modifier, which does not run on insertion, but runs whenever any of its passed
values _change_, allowing you to update the element:

```js
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class ScrollComponent extends Component {
  @action
  setColor(element, color) {
    element.style.color = color;
  }
}
```

```hbs
<div
  {{did-insert this.setColor @color}}
  {{did-update this.setColor @color}}
>
  ...
</div>
```

These three modifiers are basic modifiers that allow you to cover most of the
functionality that lifecycle hooks contained. APIs for writing your _own_
modifiers are currently being stabilized, and these will allow you to make
specific modifiers that target your use cases.

##### Template-Only Glimmer Components

In Octane, template-only components are _Glimmer_ components instead of classic
components. The three major differences with Glimmer components are:

1. As discussed before, they have outer HTML semantics, so they don't have a
   wrapping element.
2. Bindings are one-way, as mentioned above.
3. They don't have a backing _instance_, and can only access arguments values.
   They are effectively _stateless_ in this way.

Before:

```hbs
Hello, {{this.name}}!
```

After:

```hbs
<div>
  Hello, {{@name}}!
</div>
```

One consequence of this is that attempting to change a component's state through
bindings will not work:

```hbs
<!--
  This does not work, since @value is
  an argument and is immutable
-->
{{input value=@value}}

<!--
  Instead, we should update the value
  by passing an _action_ to the component
-->
{{input value=@value key-up=@updateValue}}
```

Additionally, the `mut` helper generally can't be used for the same reason:

```hbs
<!-- This does not work -->
<input
  value={{@value}}
  onkeyup={{action (mut @value) target="value"}}
/>

<!-- Do this instead -->
<input value={{@value}} onkeyup={{@updateValue}}/>
```

Template-only Glimmer components can be thought of as _functional_ components,
in the sense that their output (the rendered template) is a pure function of
their inputs (their arguments). The fact that they can't have state makes them
much easier to reason about in general, and less prone to errors.
