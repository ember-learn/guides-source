## What is Ember Octane?

Octane, Ember's first Edition, was [released in December 2019](https://blog.emberjs.com/ember-3-15-released)

Ember Octane introduced a programming model in Ember that brought major gains in productivity and performance, incrementally via a series of minor (non-breaking) releases.
This allows for new apps to have the best features enabled automatically, while teams working on existing apps can migrate over time and continue updating their app's dependency versions.
