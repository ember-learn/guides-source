Component templates can leave a placeholder that users of the component can fill
with their own HTML.

To make it more concrete, let's take a look at two similar components
representing different user's messages.

```handlebars {data-filename="app/components/received-message.hbs"}
<aside>
  <div class="avatar is-active" title="Tomster's avatar">T</div>
</aside>
<section>
  <h4 class="username">
    Tomster
    <span class="local-time">their local time is 4:56pm</span>
  </h4>

  <p>
    Hey Zoey, have you had a chance to look at the EmberConf
    brainstorming doc I sent you?
  </p>
</section>
```

```handlebars {data-filename="app/components/sent-address.hbs"}
<aside class="current-user">
  <div class="avatar" title="Zoey's avatar">Z</div>
</aside>
<section>
  <h4 class="username">Zoey</h4>

  <p>Hey!</p>

  <p>
    I love the ideas! I'm really excited about where this year's
    EmberConf is going, I'm sure it's going to be the best one yet.
    Some quick notes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Definitely agree that we should double the coffee budget this
      year (it really is impressive how much we go through!)
    </li>
    <li>
      A blimp would definitely make the venue very easy to find, but
      I think it might be a bit out of our budget. Maybe we could
      rent some spotlights instead?
    </li>
    <li>
      We absolutely will need more hamster wheels, last year's line
      was <em>way</em> too long. Will get on that now before rental
      season hits its peak.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Let me know when you've nailed down the dates!</p>
</section>
```

If we wanted to create a single, generic message component, we could swap out
the avatar and username with more generic components. Their structure is pretty
straightforward and similar, so we can use arguments and conditionals to handle
the differences in content between them (see the previous chapters for details
on how to do this).

```handlebars {data-filename="app/components/message.hbs"}
<Message::Avatar
  @title={{@avatarTitle}}
  @initial={{@avatarInitial}}
  @isActive={{@userIsActive}}
  class="{{if @isCurrentUser "current-user"}}"
/>
<section>
  <Message::Username
    @name={{@username}}
    @localTime={{@userLocalTime}}
  />

  ...
</section>
```

This works pretty well, but the message content is very different. It's also
pretty long, so it wouldn't really be easy to pass through as an argument. What
we really want is to leave a placeholder for any content supplied by the
`<Message>` tag.

The way we do that in Ember is the `{{yield}}` syntax.

```handlebars {data-filename="app/components/message.hbs"}
<Message::Avatar
  @title={{@avatarTitle}}
  @initial={{@avatarInitial}}
  @isActive={{@userIsActive}}
  class="{{if @isCurrentUser "current-user"}}"
/>
<section>
  <Message::Username
    @name={{@username}}
    @localTime={{@userLocalTime}}
  />

  {{yield}}
</section>
```

You can think of `{{yield}}` as leaving a placeholder for the content of the
`<Message>` tag.

```handlebars {app/components/received-message.hbs}
<Message
  @username="Tomster"
  @userIsActive={{true}}
  @userLocalTime="4:56pm"

  @avatarTitle="Tomster's avatar"
  @avatarInitial="T"
>
  <p>
    Hey Zoey, have you had a chance to look at the EmberConf
    brainstorming doc I sent you?
  </p>
</Message>
```

```handlebars {app/components/sent-message.hbs}
<Message
  @username="Zoey"
  @isCurrentUser={{true}}

  @avatarTitle="Zoey's avatar"
  @avatarInitial="Z"
>
  <p>Hey!</p>

</Message>
```

We call the content of the `<Message>` tag "the block" and say that `{{yield}}`
is "yielding to the block."

<div class="cta">
  <div class="cta-note">
    <div class="cta-note-body">
      <div class="cta-note-heading">Zoey says...</div>
      <div class="cta-note-message">
        You can think of the <code>Message</code> component like a function,
        and the block as a <em>callback</em> that you're passing to the
        component. From this perspective, the <code>{{yield}}</code> syntax
        calls the callback.
      </div>
    </div>
    <img src="/images/mascots/zoey.png" role="presentation" alt="">
  </div>
</div>
