Like we mentioned at the beginning of this section, components are like custom,
user-defined HTML elements. So far we've seen how to pass argument values
into components, which is similar to passing attributes into HTML elements like
`input`s, `select`s, or `dialog`s and how components can use these argument values
in both their JavaScript and template. We've also seen how you can pass
actual HTML attributes forward, allowing you to customize the elements that
components produce.

But how do we make these components interactive? How do we respond to user
actions like clicks, scrolls, touch events, etc? And how do we add our own
events to our components, to send back in the opposite direction? How does data
flow back out of the component to the parent?

In Ember, interactivity is handled by **actions**. Actions are functions that
can be used in Ember templates to respond to _events_, and can be used to
respond to and communicate changes.

## Actions

Imagine we're building an application where users can have accounts. We need to
build the UI for users to delete their account. Because we don't want users to
accidentally delete their accounts, we'll build a button that requires the user
to confirm in order to trigger some action.

We'll call this the `ButtonWithConfirmation` component. We can start off with a
normal component definition, like we've seen before:

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/components/button-with-confirmation.hbs}
<button type="button">{{@text}}</button>

{{#if this.showConfirmation}}
  <div class="confirm-dialog">
    <button class="confirm-submit">
      OK
    </button>
    <button class="confirm-cancel">
      Cancel
    </button>
  </div>
{{/if}}
```

```js {data-filename=app/components/button-with-confirmation.js}
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';

export default class ButtonWithConfirmation extends Component {
  @tracked showConfirmation = false;
}
```

Now we have a button that can receive some text as an argument, with a modal
confirmation that will show conditionally based on its `showConfirmation`
property. You'll notice this property is decorated with the `@tracked`
decorator - this is known as a _tracked property_, and indicates to Ember that
the field will change in value over time. We'll discuss this more in the section
on [State Management](../../state-management/).

Next, we need to hook up the button to toggle that property. We'll
do this with an _action_:

```js {data-filename=app/components/button-with-confirmation.js}
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class ButtonWithConfirmation extends Component {
  @tracked showConfirmation = false;

  @action
  launchConfirmDialog() {
    this.showConfirmation = true;
  }
}
```

Like we discussed [Templating](../../templates/actions/), actions are methods
that are decorated with the `@action` decorator, and which can be used in
templates. We can assign the action to our button using the `{{action}}`
modifier:

```handlebars
<button {{action this.launchConfirmationDialog}}>
  {{@text}}
</button>

{{#if this.showConfirmation}}
  <div class="confirm-dialog">
    <button class="confirm-submit">
      OK
    </button>
    <button class="confirm-cancel">
      Cancel
    </button>
  </div>
{{/if}}
```

Now if we click on the button, it will show the confirmation dialog - our first
interactive component! We'll also want the modal to close when we click either
of the modal buttons, so we can add a couple more actions to handle that:

```js {data-filename=app/components/button-with-confirmation.js}
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class ButtonWithConfirmation extends Component {
  @tracked showConfirmation = false;

  @action
  launchConfirmDialog() {
    this.showConfirmation = true;
  }

  @action
  submitConfirm() {
    this.showConfirmation = false;
  }

  @action
  cancelConfirm() {
    this.showConfirmation = false;
  }
}
```

```handlebars
<button {{action this.launchConfirmationDialog}}>
  {{@text}}
</button>

{{#if this.showConfirmation}}
  <div class="confirm-dialog">
    <button
      class="confirm-submit"
      {{action this.submitConfirm}}
    >
      OK
    </button>
    <button
      class="confirm-cancel"
      {{action this.cancelConfirm}}
    >
      Cancel
    </button>
  </div>
{{/if}}
```

Now we can open and close the modal dialog at will! Next, we'll setup the
component to send its _own_ events when the user clicks the "OK" and "Cancel"
buttons.

## Custom Events

Let's create a parent component, the `UserProfile` component, where the user can
delete their profile:

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/components/user-profile.hbs}
<ButtonWithConfirmation
  @text="Click OK to delete your account."
/>
```

First we'll define what we want to happen when the user clicks the button and
then confirms. In the first case, we'll find the user's account and delete it.

We'll implement an action on the parent component called
`userDidDeleteAccount()` that, when called, gets a hypothetical `login`
[service](../../services/) and calls the service's `deleteUser()`
method. We'll go over services later on - for now, think of it as an API
that manages the user's login and information.

```javascript {data-filename=app/components/user-profile.js}
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class UserProfile extends Component {
  @service login;

  @action
  userDidDeleteAccount() {
    this.login.deleteUser();
  }
}
```

Now we've implemented our action, but we have not told Ember when we want this
action to be triggered, which is the next step.

## Passing Down the Action

In order to trigger the action when the user clicks "OK" in the
`ButtonWithConfirmation` component, we'll need to pass the action _down_ to it
as an argument:

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/components/user-profile.hbs}
<ButtonWithConfirmation
  @text="Click OK to delete your account."
  @onConfirm={{this.userDidDeleteAccount}}
/>
```

Next, in the child component we will implement the logic to confirm that the
user wants to take the action they indicated by clicking the button:

```javascript {data-filename=app/components/button-with-confirmation.js}
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class ButtonWithConfirmation extends Component {
  @tracked showConfirmation = false;

  @action
  launchConfirmDialog() {
    this.showConfirmation = true;
  }

  @action
  submitConfirm() {
    if (this.args.onConfirm) {
      this.args.onConfirm();
    }

    this.showConfirmation = false;
  }

  @action
  cancelConfirm() {
    this.showConfirmation = false;
  }
}
```

Now, when we click on the confirm button, the `submitConfirm` action will also
call the `userDidDeleteAccount` action, which was passed down as an argument to
the confirmation button component. In this way, the `@onConfirm` argument is
like an event which our `ButtonWithConfirmation` component triggers.

## Handling Action Completion

Often actions perform asynchronous tasks, such as making an ajax request to a
server. Since actions are functions that can be passed in by a parent component,
they are able to return values when called. The most common scenario is for an
action to return a promise so that the component can handle the action's
completion.

In our `ButtonWithConfirmation` component we want to leave the confirmation
modal open until we know that the operation has completed successfully. This is
accomplished by expecting a promise to be returned from `onConfirm`. Upon
resolution of the promise, we set a property used to indicate the visibility of
the confirmation modal. We can use an `async` function to handle that promise:

```javascript {data-filename=app/components/button-with-confirmation.js}
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class ButtonWithConfirmation extends Component {
  @tracked showConfirmation = false;

  @action
  launchConfirmDialog() {
    this.showConfirmation = true;
  }

  @action
  async submitConfirm() {
    if (this.args.onConfirm) {
      await this.args.onConfirm();
    }

    this.showConfirmation = false;
  }

  @action
  cancelConfirm() {
    this.showConfirmation = false;
  }
}
```

## Passing Arguments

Sometimes the parent component invoking an action has some context needed for
the action that the child component doesn't. Consider, for example, the case
where the `ButtonWithConfirmation` component we've defined is used within
`SendMessage`. The `sendMessage` action that we pass to the child component may
expect a message type parameter to be provided as an argument:

```javascript {data-filename=app/components/send-message.js}
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class SendMessage extends Component {
  @action
  sendMessage(messageType) {
    // send message here and return a promise
  }
}
```

However, the `ButtonWithConfirmation` component invoking the action doesn't know
or care what type of message it's collecting. In cases like this, the parent
template can provide the required parameter when the action is passed to the
child. For example, if we want to use the button to send a message of type
`"info"`:

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/components/send-message.hbs}
<ButtonWithConfirmation
  @text="Click to send your message."
  @onConfirm={{action this.sendMessage "info"}}
/>
```

Within `ButtonWithConfirmation`, the code in the `submitConfirm` action does not
change. It will still invoke `onConfirm` without explicit arguments:

```javascript {data-filename=app/components/button-with-confirmation.js}
const promise = this.onConfirm();
```

However the expression `{{action this.sendMessage "info"}}` used in passing the
action to the component creates a closure, i.e. an object that binds the
parameter we've provided to the function specified. So now when the action is
invoked, that parameter will automatically be passed as its argument,
effectively calling `sendMessage("info")`, despite the argument not appearing in
the calling code.

So far in our example, the action we have passed to `ButtonWithConfirmation` is
a function that accepts one argument, `messageType`. Suppose we want to extend
this by allowing `sendMessage` to take a second argument, the actual text of the
message the user is sending:

```javascript {data-filename=app/components/send-message.js}
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class SendMessage extends Component {
  @action
  sendMessage(messageType, messageText) {
    // send message here and return a promise
  }
}
```

We want to arrange for the action to be invoked from within
`ButtonWithConfirmation` with both arguments. We've seen already that if we
provide a `messageType` value to the `action` helper when we insert
`ButtonWithConfirmation` into its parent `SendMessage` template, that value will
be passed to the `sendMessage` action as its first argument automatically when
invoked as `onConfirm`. If we subsequently pass a single additional argument to
`onConfirm` explicitly, that argument will be passed to `sendMessage` as its
second argument (This ability to provide arguments to a function one at a time
is known as [currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying)).

In our case, the explicit argument that we pass to `onConfirm` will be the
required `messageText`. However, remember that internally our
`ButtonWithConfirmation` component does not know or care that it is being used
in a messaging application. Therefore within the component's JavaScript file, we
will use a property `confirmValue` to represent that argument and pass it to
`onConfirm` as shown here:

```javascript {data-filename=app/components/button-with-confirmation.js}
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class ButtonWithConfirmation extends Component {
  @action
  submitConfirm() {
    if (this.args.onConfirm) {
      // call `onConfirm` with a second argument
      await this.args.onConfirm(this.confirmValue);
    }

    this.showConfirmation = false;
  }

  //...
}
```

In order for `confirmValue` to take on the value of the message text, we'll bind
the property to the value of a user input field that will appear when the button
is clicked. To accomplish this, we'll first modify the component so that it can
be used in block form and we will [yield](../yields/) `confirmValue` to the
block within the `"confirmDialog"` element:

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/components/button-with-confirmation.hbs}
<button type="button" {{action this.launchConfirmDialog}}>{{this.text}}</button>

{{#if this.confirmShown}}
  <div class="confirm-dialog">
    {{yield this.confirmValue}}
    <button class="confirm-submit" type="button" {{action this.submitConfirm}}>OK</button>
    <button class="confirm-cancel" type="button" {{action this.cancelConfirm}}>Cancel</button>
  </div>
{{/if}}
```

With this modification, we can now use the component in `SendMessage` to wrap a
text input element whose `value` attribute is set to `confirmValue`:

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/components/send-message.hbs}
<ButtonWithConfirmation
  @text="Click to send your message."
  @onConfirm={{action this.sendMessage "info"}}
as |confirmValue|>
  <Input @value={{confirmValue}} />
</ButtonWithConfirmation>
```

When the user enters their message into the input field, the message text will
now be available to the component as `confirmValue`. Then, once they click the
"OK" button, the `submitConfirm` action will be triggered, calling `onConfirm`
with the provided `confirmValue`, thus invoking the `sendMessage` action in
`SendMessage` with both the `messageType` and `messageText` arguments.

## Invoking Actions Directly on Component Collaborators

Actions can be invoked on objects other than the component directly from the
template. For example, in our `SendMessage` component we might include a service
that processes the `sendMessage` logic.

```javascript {data-filename=app/components/send-message.js}
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';

export default class SendMessage extends Component {
  @service messaging;

  // component implementation
}
```

We can tell the action to invoke the `sendMessage` action directly on the
messaging service.

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/components/send-message.hbs}
<ButtonWithConfirmation
  @text="Click to send your message."
  @onConfirm={{action this.messaging.sendMessage "info"}}
as |confirmValue|>
  <Input @value={{confirmValue}} />
</ButtonWithConfirmation>
```

The interesting part is that the action from the service just works, because
it's auto-bound to that service.

```javascript {data-filename=app/services/messaging.js}
import Service from '@ember/service';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class Messaging extends Service {
  @action
  sendMessage(messageType, text) {
    // handle message send and return a promise
  }
}
```

## Destructuring Objects Passed as Action Arguments

A component will often not know what information a parent needs to process an
action, and will just pass all the information it has. For example, our
`UserProfile` component is going to notify its parent,
`system-preferences-editor`, that a user's account was deleted, and passes along
with it the full user profile object.

```javascript {data-filename=app/components/user-profile.js}
import Component from '@ember/component';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class UserProfile extends Component {
  @service login;

  @action
  userDidDeleteAccount() {
    this.login.deleteUser();
    this.didDelete(this.login.currentUserObj);
  }
}
```

All our `system-preferences-editor` component really needs to process a user
deletion is an account ID. For this case, the action helper provides the `value`
attribute to allow a parent component to dig into the passed object to pull out
only what it needs.

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/components/system-preferences-editor.hbs}
<UserProfile @didDelete={{action this.userDeleted value="account.id"}} />
```

Now when the `system-preferences-editor` handles the delete action, it receives
only the user's account `id` string.

```javascript {data-filename=app/components/system-preferences-editor.js}
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class SystemPreferencesEditor extends Component {
  @action
  userDeleted(idStr) {
    // respond to deletion
  }
}
```

## Calling Actions Up Multiple Component Layers

When your components go multiple template layers deep, it is common to need to
handle an action several layers up the tree. Using the action helper, parent
components can pass actions to child components through templates alone without
adding JavaScript code to those child components.

For example, say we want to move account deletion from the `UserProfile`
component to its parent `system-preferences-editor`.

First we would move the `deleteUser` action from `user-profile.js` to
the parent `system-preferences-editor.js`.

```javascript {data-filename=app/components/system-preferences-editor.js}
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class SystemPreferencesEditor extends Component {
  @service login;

  @action
  deleteUser(idStr) {
    return this.login.deleteUserAccount(idStr);
  }
}
```

Then our `system-preferences-editor` template passes its local `deleteUser`
action into the `UserProfile` as that component's `deleteCurrentUser` argument.

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/components/system-preferences-editor.hbs}
<UserProfile
  @deleteCurrentUser={{action this.deleteUser this.login.currentUser.id}}
/>
```

The `deleteUser` action is prepended with `this.`, since
`system-preferences-editor` is where the action is defined now. If the action
was passed from a parent, then it might have looked like `@deleteUser` instead.

In our `user-profile.hbs` template we change our action to call
`deleteCurrentUser` as passed above.

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/components/user-profile.hbs}
<ButtonWithConfirmation
  @text="Click OK to delete your account."
  @onConfirm={{@deleteCurrentUser}}
/>
```

Note that `deleteCurrentUser` is now prepended with `@` as opposed to `this.`
[previously](#toc_passing-the-action-to-the-component).

Now when you confirm deletion, the action goes straight to the
`SystemPreferencesEditor` to be handled in its local context.

## String Action Syntax

Historically the `{{action}}` helper (`<MyComponent @onClick=(action 'clickedButton')>`)
and element modifier (`<button {{action 'clickedButton'}}>`) have accepted a
string as the first argument. This form is no longer recommended, but might be
seen in the wild when working on older Ember apps or addons.

When you encounter a string based action it should be refactored to use the
`@action` decorator (refactor away from the `actions` hash).

It is then recommended to use the action modifier directly with decorated
functions.

```handlebars
<button {{action this.confirmDelete this.user}}>Confirm Delete</button>
```
