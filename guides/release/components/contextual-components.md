The
[`{{component}}`](https://www.emberjs.com/api/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/component?anchor=component)
helper can be used to defer the selection of a component to run time. The
`<MyComponent />` syntax always renders the same component, while using the
`{{component}}` helper allows choosing a component to render on the fly. This is
useful in cases where you want to interact with different external libraries
depending on the data. Using the `{{component}}` helper would allow you to keep
different logic well separated.

The first parameter of the helper is the name of a component to render, as a
string. So `{{component 'blog-post'}}` is the same as using `<BlogPost />`.

The real value of
[`{{component}}`](https://www.emberjs.com/api/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/component?anchor=component)
comes from being able to dynamically pick the component being rendered. Below is
an example of using the helper as a means of choosing different components for
displaying different kinds of posts:

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/components/foo-component.hbs}
<h3>Hello from foo!</h3>
<p>{{this.post.body}}</p>
```

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/components/bar-component.hbs}
<h3>Hello from bar!</h3>
<div>{{this.post.author}}</div>
```

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/index.hbs}
{{#each this.myPosts as |post|}}
  {{!-- either foo-component or bar-component --}}
  {{component post.postType post=post}}
{{/each}}
```

or

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/index.hbs}
{{#each this.myPosts as |post|}}
  {{!-- either foo-component or bar-component --}}
  {{#let (component post.postType) as |Post|}}
    <Post @post={{post}} />
  {{/let}}
{{/each}}
```

When the parameter passed to `{{component}}` evaluates to `null` or `undefined`,
the helper renders nothing. When the parameter changes, the currently rendered
component is destroyed and the new component is created and brought in.

Picking different components to render in response to the data allows you to
have different template and behavior for each case. The `{{component}}` helper
is a powerful tool for improving code modularity.
