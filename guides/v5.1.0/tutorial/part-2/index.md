Hooray, you've made it to the second part of the tutorial! In the following sections, we'll build on the core concepts that we learned in the first part of the tutorial.

Along the way, we'll also add some new features to our Super Rentals app. By the end of this section, we'll have implemented some search functionality and refactored a good bit of our code to use some new Ember concepts

In part two, we'll cover the following concepts:

- Dynamic segments
- Ember services
- EmberData
- Adapters and serializers

We're going to cover a lot of ground, so let's get learning!
