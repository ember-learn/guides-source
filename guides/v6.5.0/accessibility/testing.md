## Screen Reader and Browser Combinations

It is important to use a screen reader when checking to make sure your application is accessible. 

There are assistive technologies (known as screen readers) available for all common desktop platforms and mobile devices. 

- VoiceOver, integrated in Apple products
- Narrator, integrated in Windows products
- Orca, available for integration in Ubuntu, otherwise available as a download
- JAWS, proprietary software by Freedom Scientific, available for Windows
- NVDA, open source software, available for Windows
- TalkBack, integrated in Android products

While developing and testing for conformance, keep in mind that there are well-known screen reader and browser combinations that were developed in a way that work well together; using combinations different than these may produce false-positive results. It should be noted that these may change over time, so periodic review of this list is recommended. 

- Firefox & NVDA (Windows)
- IE & JAWS (Windows)
- Edge & Narrator (Windows)
- Safari & VoiceOver (MacOS)

The absolute best method for learning how a screen reader works is using one yourself! It might feel a little awkward at first, but understanding how to use a screen reader (and other assistive technology) will help you become a more skilled developer.
