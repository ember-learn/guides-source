You can use the View Tree to inspect your application's current state.
The View Tree shows you the currently rendered templates, models, controllers, and components, in a tree format. Click on the `View Tree` menu on the left to see these.

Use the tips described in [Object Inspector](../object-inspector) to inspect models and controllers. See below for templates and components.

### Inspecting Templates

To see how a template was rendered by Ember, click on the template in the View Tree. If 
you're using Chrome or Firefox, you'll be sent to the Elements panel with that DOM element selected.

### Components and Inline Views

The View Tree ignores components and inline views by default. To load these into the View Tree check the `Components` and `All Views` checkboxes.

You can then inspect components using the Object Inspector.


### Highlighting Templates

#### Hovering over the View Tree

When you hover over the items in the View Tree, the related templates will be
highlighted in your app. For every highlighted template, you can see the
template name, and its associated objects.

#### Hovering over the app

If you want to highlight a template or component directly within your app, click on the magnifying glass in the Inspector, then hover over the app.
As your our mouse passes over it, the related template or component will be
highlighted.

If you click on a highlighted template or component, the Inspector will select it. You can then
click on the backing objects to send them to the object inspector.

Click on the `X` button to deselect a template.


### Duration

The Duration column displays the render time for a given template, including the template's children.

By measuring the render time, the Inspector adds a slight delay to the rendering process. As such, the duration is not an exact representation of expected rendering time for a production application. Thus, the rendering duration is more useful to compare times than as an absolute measure of performance.
