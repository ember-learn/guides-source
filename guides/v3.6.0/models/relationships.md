Ember Data includes several built-in relationship types to help you
define how your models relate to each other.

### One-to-One

To declare a one-to-one relationship between two models, use
`DS.belongsTo`:

```javascript {data-filename=app/models/user.js}
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  profile: DS.belongsTo('profile')
});
```

```javascript {data-filename=app/models/profile.js}
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  user: DS.belongsTo('user')
});
```

### One-to-Many

To declare a one-to-many relationship between two models, use
`DS.belongsTo` in combination with `DS.hasMany`, like this:

```javascript {data-filename=app/models/blog-post.js}
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  comments: DS.hasMany('comment')
});
```

```javascript {data-filename=app/models/comment.js}
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  blogPost: DS.belongsTo('blog-post')
});
```

### Many-to-Many

To declare a many-to-many relationship between two models, use
`DS.hasMany`:

```javascript {data-filename=app/models/blog-post.js}
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  tags: DS.hasMany('tag')
});
```

```javascript {data-filename=app/models/tag.js}
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  blogPosts: DS.hasMany('blog-post')
});
```

### Explicit Inverses

Ember Data will do its best to discover which relationships map to one
another. In the one-to-many code above, for example, Ember Data can figure out that
changing the `comments` relationship should update the `blogPost`
relationship on the inverse because `blogPost` is the only relationship to
that model.

However, sometimes you may have multiple `belongsTo`/`hasMany`s for
the same type. You can specify which property on the related model is
the inverse using `DS.belongsTo` or `DS.hasMany`'s `inverse`
option. Relationships without an inverse can be indicated as such by
including `{ inverse: null }`.


```javascript {data-filename=app/models/comment.js}
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  onePost: DS.belongsTo('blog-post', { inverse: null }),
  twoPost: DS.belongsTo('blog-post'),
  redPost: DS.belongsTo('blog-post'),
  bluePost: DS.belongsTo('blog-post')
});
```

```javascript {data-filename=app/models/blog-post.js}
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  comments: DS.hasMany('comment', {
    inverse: 'redPost'
  })
});
```

### Reflexive Relations

When you want to define a reflexive relation (a model that has a relationship to
itself), you must explicitly define the inverse relationship. If there
is no inverse relationship then you can set the inverse to `null`.

Here's an example of a one-to-many reflexive relationship:

```javascript {data-filename=app/models/folder.js}
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  children: DS.hasMany('folder', { inverse: 'parent' }),
  parent: DS.belongsTo('folder', { inverse: 'children' })
});
```

Here's an example of a one-to-one reflexive relationship:

```javascript {data-filename=app/models/user.js}
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  name: DS.attr('string'),
  bestFriend: DS.belongsTo('user', { inverse: 'bestFriend' }),
});
```

You can also define a reflexive relationship that doesn't have an inverse:

```javascript {data-filename=app/models/folder.js}
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  parent: DS.belongsTo('folder', { inverse: null })
});
```

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a powerful concept which allows a developer
to abstract common functionality into a base class. Consider the
following example: a user with multiple payment methods. They
could have a linked PayPal account, and a couple credit cards on
file.

Note that, for polymorphism to work, Ember Data expects a
"type" declaration polymorphic type via the reserved `type`
property on the model. Confused? See the API response below.

First, let's look at the model definitions:

```javascript {data-filename=app/models/user.js}
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  paymentMethods: DS.hasMany('payment-method', { polymorphic: true })
});
```

```javascript {data-filename=app/models/payment-method.js}
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  user: DS.belongsTo('user', { inverse: 'paymentMethods' }),
});
```

```javascript {data-filename=app/models/payment-method-cc.js}
import { computed } from '@ember/object';
import PaymentMethod from './payment-method';

export default PaymentMethod.extend({
  last4: DS.attr(),

  obfuscatedIdentifier: computed('last4', function () {
    return `**** **** **** ${this.last4}`;
  })
});
```

```javascript {data-filename=app/models/payment-method-paypal.js}
import { computed } from '@ember/object';
import DS from 'ember-data';
import PaymentMethod from './payment-method'

export default PaymentMethod.extend({
  linkedEmail: DS.attr(),

  obfuscatedIdentifier: computed('linkedEmail', function () {
    let last5 = this.linkedEmail.split('').reverse().slice(0, 5).reverse().join('');

    return `••••${last5}`;
  })
});
```

And our API might setup these relationships like so:

```json
{
	"data": {
		"id": "8675309",
		"type": "user",
		"attributes": {
			"name": "Anfanie Farmeo"
		},
		"relationships": {
			"payment-methods": {
				"data": [{
					"id": "1",
					"type": "payment-method-paypal"
				}, {
					"id": "2",
					"type": "payment-method-cc"
				}, {
					"id": "3",
					"type": "payment-method-apple-pay"
				}]
			}
		}
	},
	"included": [{
		"id": "1",
		"type": "payment-method-paypal",
		"attributes": {
			"linked-email": "ryan@gosling.io"
		}
	}, {
		"id": "2",
		"type": "payment-method-cc",
		"attributes": {
			"last4": "1335"
		}
	}, {
		"id": "3",
		"type": "payment-method-apple-pay",
		"attributes": {
			"last4": "5513"
		}
	}]
}
```

### Readonly Nested Data

Some models may have properties that are deeply nested objects of
readonly data. The naïve solution would be to define models for each
nested object and use `hasMany` and `belongsTo` to recreate the nested
relationship. However, since readonly data will never need to be
updated and saved this often results in the creation of a great deal
of code for very little benefit. An alternate approach is to define
these relationships using an attribute with no transform
(`DS.attr()`). This makes it easy to access readonly values in
computed properties and templates without the overhead of defining
extraneous models.

### Creating Records

Let's assume that we have a `blog-post` and a `comment` model. A single blog post can have several comments linked to it. The correct relationship is shown below:

```javascript {data-filename=app/models/blog-post.js}
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  comments: DS.hasMany('comment')
});
```

```javascript {data-filename=app/models/comment.js}
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  blogPost: DS.belongsTo('blog-post')
});
```

Now, suppose we want to add comments to an existing blogPost. We can do this in two ways, but for both of them, we first need to look up a blog post that is already loaded in the store, using its id:

```javascript
let myBlogPost = this.store.peekRecord('blog-post', 1);
```
Now we can either set the `belongsTo` relationship in our new comment, or, update the blogPost's `hasMany` relationship. As you might observe, we don't need to set both `hasMany` and `belongsTo` for a record. Ember Data will do that for us.

First, let's look at setting the `belongsTo` relationship in our new comment:

```javascript
let comment = this.store.createRecord('comment', {
  blogPost: myBlogPost
});
comment.save();
```

In the above snippet, we have referenced `myBlogPost` while creating the record. This will let Ember know that the newly created comment belongs to `myBlogPost`.
This will create a new `comment` record and save it to the server. Ember Data will also update `myBlogPost` to include our newly created comment in its `comments` relationship.

The second way of doing the same thing is to link the two records together by updating the blogPost's `hasMany` relationship as shown below:

```javascript
let comment = this.store.createRecord('comment', {
});
myBlogPost.get('comments').pushObject(comment);
comment.save().then(function () {
  myBlogPost.save();
});
```

In this above case, the new comment's `belongsTo` relationship will be automatically set to the parent blogPost.

Although `createRecord` is fairly straightforward, the only thing to watch out for
is that you cannot assign a promise as a relationship, currently.

For example, if you want to set the `author` property of a blogPost, this would **not** work
if the `user` with id isn't already loaded into the store:

```javascript
this.store.createRecord('blog-post', {
  title: 'Rails is Omakase',
  body: 'Lorem ipsum',
  author: this.store.findRecord('user', 1)
});
```

However, you can easily set the relationship after the promise has fulfilled:

```javascript
let blogPost = this.store.createRecord('blog-post', {
  title: 'Rails is Omakase',
  body: 'Lorem ipsum'
});

this.store.findRecord('user', 1).then(function(user) {
  blogPost.set('author', user);
});
```

### Retrieving Related Records

When you request data from the server for a model that has relationships with one or more others,
you may want to retrieve records corresponding to those related models at the same time.
For example, when retrieving a blog post, you may need to access the comments associated
with the post as well.
The [JSON API specification allows](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes)
servers to accept a query parameter with the key `include` as a request to
include those related records in the response returned to the client.
The value of the parameter should be a comma-separated list of names of the
relationships required.

If you are using an adapter that supports JSON API, such as Ember's default [`JSONAPIAdapter`](https://www.emberjs.com/api/ember-data/release/classes/DS.JSONAPIAdapter),
you can easily add the `include` parameter to the server requests created by
the `findRecord()`, `findAll()`,
`query()` and `queryRecord()` methods.

`findRecord()` and `findAll()` each take an `options` argument in which you can
specify the `include` parameter.
For example, given a `post` model that has a `hasMany` relationship with a `comment` model,
when retrieving a specific post we can have the server also return that post's comments
as follows:

```javascript {data-filename=app/routes/post.js}
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';

export default Route.extend({
  model(params) {
   return this.store.findRecord('post', params.post_id, {include: 'comments'});
  }
});
```
The post's comments would then be available in your template as `model.comments`.

Nested relationships can be specified in the `include` parameter as a dot-separated sequence of relationship names.
So to request both the post's comments and the authors of those comments the request
would look like this:

```javascript {data-filename=app/routes/post.js}
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';

export default Route.extend({
  model(params) {
   return this.store.findRecord('post', params.post_id, {include: 'comments,comments.author'});
  }
});
```
The `query()` and `queryRecord()` methods each take a `query` argument that is
serialized directly into the URL query string and the `include` parameter may
form part of that argument.
For example:

```javascript {data-filename=app/routes/adele.js}
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';

export default Route.extend({
  model() {
    // GET to /artists?filter[name]=Adele&include=albums
    this.store.query('artist', {
      filter: {name: 'Adele'},
      include: 'albums'
    }).then(function(artists) {
      return artists.get('firstObject');
    });
  }
});
```

### Updating Existing Records

Sometimes we want to set relationships on already existing records. We can simply set a `belongsTo` relationship:

```javascript
let blogPost = this.store.peekRecord('blog-post', 1);
let comment = this.store.peekRecord('comment', 1);
comment.set('blogPost', blogPost);
comment.save();
```

Alternatively, we could update the `hasMany` relationship by pushing a record into the relationship:

```javascript
let blogPost = this.store.peekRecord('blog-post', 1);
let comment = this.store.peekRecord('comment', 1);
blogPost.get('comments').pushObject(comment);
blogPost.save();
```

### Removing Relationships

To remove a `belongsTo` relationship, we can set it to `null`, which will also remove it from the `hasMany` side:

```javascript
let comment = this.store.peekRecord('comment', 1);
comment.set('blogPost', null);
comment.save();
```

It is also possible to remove a record from a `hasMany` relationship:

```javascript
let blogPost = this.store.peekRecord('blog-post', 1);
let comment = this.store.peekRecord('comment', 1);
blogPost.get('comments').removeObject(comment);
blogPost.save();
```

As in the earlier examples, the comment's `belongsTo` relationship will also be cleared by Ember Data.

### Relationships as Promises

While working with relationships it is important to remember that they return promises.

For example, if we were to work on a blogPost's asynchronous comments, we would have to wait until the promise has fulfilled:

```javascript
let blogPost = this.store.peekRecord('blog-post', 1);

blogPost.get('comments').then((comments) => {
  // now we can work with the comments
});
```

The same applies to `belongsTo` relationships:

```javascript
let comment = this.store.peekRecord('comment', 1);

comment.get('blogPost').then((blogPost) => {
  // the blogPost is available here
});
```

Handlebars templates will automatically be updated to reflect a resolved promise. We can display a list of comments in a blogPost like so:

```handlebars
<ul>
  {{#each blogPost.comments as |comment|}}
    <li>{{comment.id}}</li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
```

Ember Data will query the server for the appropriate records and re-render the template once the data is received.
