In addition to configuring your app itself, you can also configure Ember CLI.
These configurations can be made by adding them to the `.ember-cli` file in your application's root. Many can also be made by passing them as arguments to the command line program.

For example, a common desire is to change the port that Ember CLI serves the app from. It's possible to pass the port number from the command line with `ember server --port 8080`. To make this configuration permanent, edit your `.ember-cli` file like so:

```json
{
  "port": 8080
}
```

For a full list of command line options, run `ember help`.
