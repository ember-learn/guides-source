The Routes tab displays a list of your application's routes.

For the following code:

```javascript
this.route('posts', function() {
  this.route('new');
});
```

The Inspector displays these routes:

As you can see, the Inspector shows the routes you defined as well as the routes
automatically generated by Ember.

### Viewing the Current Route

The Inspector highlights the currently active routes. However, if your app has grown too large for this to be useful, you can use the `Current Route Only`
checkbox to hide all routes except the currently active ones.
