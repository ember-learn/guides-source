_Container testing methods and computed properties follow previous patterns shown
in [Testing Basics] because Ember.Route extends Ember.Object._

Testing routes can be done both via application tests or container tests. Application tests
will likely provide better coverage for routes because routes are typically used
to perform transitions and load data, both of which are tested more easily in
full context rather than isolation.

That being said, sometimes it is important to test your routes in a smaller scope. For example,
let's say we'd like to have an alert that can be triggered from anywhere within
our application. The alert function `displayAlert` should be put into the
`ApplicationRoute` because all actions and events bubble up to it from
sub-routes and controllers.

```javascript {data-filename=app/routes/application.js}
import Route from '@ember/route';

export default Route.extend({
  actions: {
    displayAlert(text) {
      this._displayAlert(text);
    }
  },

  _displayAlert(text) {
    alert(text);
  }
});
```

In this route we've [separated our concerns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns):
The action `displayAlert` contains the code that is called when the action is
received, and the private function `_displayAlert` performs the work. While not
necessarily obvious here because of the small size of the functions, separating
code into smaller chunks (or "concerns") allows it to be more readily isolated
for testing, which in turn allows you to catch bugs more easily.

Here is an example of test this route in an isolated test case:

```javascript {data-filename=tests/unit/routes/application-test.js}
import { module, test } from 'qunit';
import { setupTest } from 'ember-qunit';

let originalAlert;

module('Unit | Route | application', function(hooks) {
  setupTest(hooks);

  hooks.beforeEach(function(assert) {
    originalAlert = window.alert; // store a reference to window.alert
  });

  hooks.afterEach(function(assert) {
    window.alert = originalAlert; // restore window.alert
  });

  test('should display an alert', function(assert) {
    assert.expect(2);

    // get the route instance
    let route = this.owner.lookup('route:application');

    // stub window.alert to perform a qunit test
    const expectedTextFoo = 'foo';
    window.alert = (text) => {
      assert.equal(text, expectedTextFoo, `expect alert to display ${expectedTextFoo}`);
    };

    // call the _displayAlert function which triggers the qunit test above
    route._displayAlert(expectedTextFoo);

    // set up a second stub to perform a test with the actual action
    const expectedTextBar = 'bar';
    window.alert = (text) => {
      assert.equal(text, expectedTextBar, `expected alert to display ${expectedTextBar}`);
    };

    // Now use the routes send method to test the actual action
    route.send('displayAlert', expectedTextBar);
  });
});
```
