Calling [`transitionTo()`][1] from a route or [`transitionToRoute()`][2] from a
controller will stop any transition currently in progress and start a new
one, functioning as a redirect. `transitionTo()` behaves exactly like the
[link-to](../../templates/links/) helper.

[1]: https://api.emberjs.com/classes/Ember.Route.html#method_transitionTo
[2]: https://api.emberjs.com/classes/Ember.Controller.html#method_transitionToRoute

If the new route has dynamic segments, you need to pass either a _model_ or an _identifier_ for each segment.
Passing a model will skip that segment's `model()` hook (since the model is
already loaded).

## Transitioning Before the Model is Known

If you want to redirect from one route to another, you can do the transition in
the [`beforeModel()`][3] hook of your route handler.

[3]: https://api.emberjs.com/classes/Ember.Route.html#method_beforeModel

```javascript {data-filename=app/router.js}
Router.map(function() {
  this.route('posts');
});
```

```javascript {data-filename=app/routes/index.js}
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  beforeModel() {
    this.transitionTo('posts');
  }
});
```

If you need to examine some application state to figure out where to redirect,
you might use a [service](../../applications/services/).

## Transitioning After the Model is Known

If you need information about the current model in order to decide about
redirection, you can use the [`afterModel()`][4] hook.
It receives the resolved model as the first parameter and the transition as
the second one. For example:

[4]: https://api.emberjs.com/classes/Ember.Route.html#method_afterModel

```javascript {data-filename=app/router.js}
Router.map(function() {
  this.route('posts');
  this.route('post', { path: '/post/:post_id' });
});
```

```javascript {data-filename=app/routes/posts.js}
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  afterModel(model, transition) {
    if (model.get('length') === 1) {
      this.transitionTo('post', model.get('firstObject'));
    }
  }
});
```

When transitioning to the `posts` route if it turns out that there is only one post,
the current transition will be aborted in favor of redirecting to the `PostRoute`
with the single post object being its model.

### Child Routes

Let's change the router above to use a nested route, like this:

```javascript {data-filename=app/router.js}
Router.map(function() {
  this.route('posts', function() {
    this.route('post', { path: ':post_id' });
  });
});
```

If we redirect to `posts.post` in the `afterModel` hook, `afterModel`
essentially invalidates the current attempt to enter this route. So the `posts`
route's `beforeModel`, `model`, and `afterModel` hooks will fire again within
the new, redirected transition. This is inefficient, since they just fired
before the redirect.

Instead, we can use the [`redirect()`][5] method, which will leave the original
transition validated, and not cause the parent route's hooks to fire again:

[5]: https://api.emberjs.com/classes/Ember.Route.html#method_redirect

```javascript {data-filename=app/routes/posts.js}
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  redirect(model, transition) {
    if (model.get('length') === 1) {
      this.transitionTo('posts.post', model.get('firstObject'));
    }
  }
});
```
