## Many different ways to contribute
There are many different ways to contribute to Ember in which you'll be able to learn more about the project along the way: For example, you can [write and share an Ember addon with the community](https://ember-cli.com/extending/#developing-addons-and-blueprints) or collaborate with the authors of your favorite addon to make it even better. You can share any of your experiences with Ember by blogging, screencasting or speaking about them at your [local Ember meetup group](https://www.emberjs.com/community/meetups/) or organizing local Ember events on your own. Helping to make Ember even better understood is in itself a great way to contribute to the community.
