Ember has a rich ecosystem of addons that can be easily added to projects.
Addons provide a wide range of functionality to projects, often saving time and letting you focus on your project.

To browse addons, visit the [Ember Observer](https://emberobserver.com/) website.  It catalogs and categorizes Ember addons that have been published to NPM and assigns them a score based on a variety of criteria.

For Super Rentals, we'll take advantage of two addons: [ember-cli-tutorial-style](https://github.com/toddjordan/ember-cli-tutorial-style) and [ember-cli-mirage](http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/).

### ember-cli-tutorial-style

Instead of having you copy/paste in CSS to style Super Rentals, we've created an addon called [ember-cli-tutorial-style](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-cli-tutorial-style) that instantly adds CSS to the tutorial.
The addon works by generating a file called `ember-tutorial.css` and putting that file in the super-rentals `vendor` directory.

The [`vendor` directory](../../addons-and-dependencies/managing-dependencies/#toc_other-assets) in Ember is a special directory where you can include content that gets compiled into your application.
When Ember CLI builds our app from our source code, it copies `ember-tutorial.css` into a file called `vendor.css`.

As Ember CLI runs, it takes the `ember-tutorial` CSS file and puts it in a file called `vendor.css`.
The `vendor.css` file is referenced in `app/index.html`, making the styles available at runtime.

We can make additional style tweaks to `vendor/ember-tutorial.css`, and the changes will take effect whenever we restart the app.

Run the following command to install the addon:

```shell
ember install ember-cli-tutorial-style
```

Here is the output:

```shell
NPM: Installed ember-cli-tutorial-style
installing ember-cli-tutorial-style
  create public/assets/images/teaching.png
  create vendor/ember-tutorial.css
Installed addon package.
```

Since Ember addons are npm packages, `ember install` installs them in the `node_modules` directory, and makes an entry
in `package.json`. Be sure to restart your server after the addon has installed successfully. Restarting the server will
incorporate the new CSS and refreshing the browser window will give you this:

### ember-cli-mirage

[Mirage](http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/) is a client HTTP stubbing library often used for Ember acceptance testing.
For the case of this tutorial, we'll use mirage as our source of data rather than a traditional backend server.
Mirage will allow us to create fake data to work with while developing our app and mimic an API.
The data and endpoints we setup here will come into play later in the tutorial, when we use Ember Data to make server requests.

Install the Mirage addon as follows:

```shell
ember install ember-cli-mirage
```

Our primary focus with mirage will be in the `config.js` file, which is where we can define our API endpoints and our data.
We will be following the [JSON-API specification](http://jsonapi.org/) which requires our data to be formatted a certain way.
Let's configure Mirage to send back our rentals that we had defined above by updating `mirage/config.js`:

```mirage/config.js{+1,+2,+3,+4,+5,+6,+7,+8,+9,+10,+11,+12,+13,+14,+15,+16,+17,+18,+19,+20,+21,+22,+23,+24,+25,+26,+27,+28,+29,+30,+31,+32,+33,+34,+35,+36,+37,+38,+39,+40,+41,+42,-43,-44,-45,-46,-47,-48,-49,-50,-51,-52,-53,-54,-55,-56,-57,-58,-59,-60,-61,-62,-63,-64,-65,-66,-67}
export default function() {
  this.namespace = '/api';

  this.get('/rentals', function() {
    return {
      data: [{
        type: 'rentals',
        id: 'grand-old-mansion',
        attributes: {
          title: 'Grand Old Mansion',
          owner: 'Veruca Salt',
          city: 'San Francisco',
          "property-type": 'Estate',
          bedrooms: 15,
          image: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Crane_estate_(5).jpg'
        }
      }, {
        type: 'rentals',
        id: 'urban-living',
        attributes: {
          title: 'Urban Living',
          owner: 'Mike Teavee',
          city: 'Seattle',
          "property-type": 'Condo',
          bedrooms: 1,
          image: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Alfonso_13_Highrise_Tegucigalpa.jpg'
        }
      }, {
        type: 'rentals',
        id: 'downtown-charm',
        attributes: {
          title: 'Downtown Charm',
          owner: 'Violet Beauregarde',
          city: 'Portland',
          "property-type": 'Apartment',
          bedrooms: 3,
          image: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Wheeldon_Apartment_Building_-_Portland_Oregon.jpg'
        }
      }]
    };
  });
}
export default function() {
 // These comments are here to help you get started. Feel free to delete them.

  /*
    Config (with defaults).

    Note: these only affect routes defined *after* them!
  */

  // this.urlPrefix = '';    // make this `http://localhost:8080`, for example, if your API is on a different server
  // this.namespace = '';    // make this `/api`, for example, if your API is namespaced
  // this.timing = 400;      // delay for each request, automatically set to 0 during testing

  /*
    Shorthand cheatsheet:

    this.get('/posts');
    this.post('/posts');
    this.get('/posts/:id');
    this.put('/posts/:id'); // or this.patch
    this.del('/posts/:id');

}
```

Mirage works by overriding the JavaScript code that makes network requests and instead returns the JSON you specify.
We should note that this means you will not see any network requests in your development tools but will instead see the JSON logged in your console.
Our update to `mirage/config.js` configures Mirage so that whenever Ember Data makes a GET request to `/api/rentals`, Mirage will return this JavaScript object as JSON and no network request is actually made.
We also specified a `namespace` of `/api` in our mirage configuration.
Without this change, navigation to `/rentals` in our application would conflict with Mirage.

In order for this to work, we need our application to default to making requests to the namespace of `/api`.
To do this, we want to generate an application adapter.
An [Adapter](../../models/customizing-adapters) is an object that [Ember Data](../../models) uses to determine how we communicate with our backend.
We will cover Ember Data in more detail later in this tutorial.
For now, let's generate an adapter for our application:

```shell
ember generate adapter application
```

This adapter will extend the [`JSONAPIAdapter`](https://www.emberjs.com/api/ember-data/2.16/classes/DS.JSONAPIAdapter) base class from Ember Data:

```app/adapters/application.js{+4}
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.JSONAPIAdapter.extend({
  namespace: 'api'
});
```

If you were running `ember serve` in another shell, restart the server to include Mirage in your build.

Note that at this point of the tutorial, the data is still provided by the `app/routes/rentals.js` file. We will make use of the mirage data we set up here in the upcoming section called [Using Ember Data](../ember-data/).
