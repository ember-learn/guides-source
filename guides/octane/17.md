The last missing feature for the `<Rental>` component is the map, which
is what we are going to work on next.

We will use the [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) API to generate maps
for our rental properties. You can [sign up](https://www.mapbox.com/signup/)
for free and without a credit card.

Mapbox provides a [static map images
API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#static-images), which serves map
images in PNG format. This means we can simply generate the appropiate
URL for the parameters we want and render it using a standard `<img>`
tag. Pretty neat!

You can explore the available options using the [interactive
playground](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/interactive-tools/static-api-playground/).

Once you have signed up for the service, find your "default public
token" from [here](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/) and paste
it into `config/environment.js`:

```js {data-filename="config/environment.js" data-diff="+9,+10"}
'use strict';

module.exports = function(environment) {
  /* ...snip... */

  if (environment === 'production') {
    // here you can enable a production-specific feature
  }

  ENV.MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'paste your mapbox access token here';

  return ENV;
};
```

As its name implies, this file is used for configuring our app and
storing API keys like these. These values can be accessed from our other
parts of our app and can have different values depending on the
current environment (development, test or production).

> Zoey says: If you prefer, you can create different access tokens for
> different environments. At minimum, they will need to have the
> "styles:tilestoken" scope in order to use the static images API.

After saving changes to your configuration file, you would have to
restart your development and test servers.
