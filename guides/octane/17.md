The last missing feature for the `<Rental>` component is the map, which is what we're going to work on next.

We will use the [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) API to generate maps for our rental properties. You can [sign up](https://www.mapbox.com/signup/) for free and without a credit card.

Mapbox provides a [static map images API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#static-images), which serves map images in PNG format. This means that we can generate the appropriate URL for the parameters we want and render it using a standard `<img>` tag. Pretty neat!

If you're curious, you can explore the options available for us to use on Mapbox by using the [interactive playground](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/interactive-tools/static-api-playground/).

Once you have signed up for the service, find your "default public token" from [here](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/) and paste it into `config/environment.js`:

```js {data-filename="config/environment.js" data-diff="+9,+10"}
'use strict';

module.exports = function(environment) {
  /* ...snip... */

  if (environment === 'production') {
    // here you can enable a production-specific feature
  }

  ENV.MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'paste your Mapbox access token here';

  return ENV;
};
```

As its name implies, this file is used for configuring our app and storing API keys like these. These values can be accessed from other parts of our app, and they can have different values depending on the current environment (which might be development, test, or production).

<div class="cta">
  <div class="cta-note">
    <div class="cta-note-body">
      <div class="cta-note-heading">Zoey says...</div>
      <div class="cta-note-message">
        If you prefer, you can create different access tokens for different environments. At a minimum, they will each need to have the "styles:tilestoken" scope in order to use the static images API.
      </div>
    </div>
    <img src="/images/mascots/zoey.png" role="presentation" alt="Ember Mascot">
  </div>
</div>

After saving all the changes to our configuration file, we will need to restart our development and test servers to pick up these file changes.
