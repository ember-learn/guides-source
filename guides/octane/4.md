To match mockup from our designer, we will also need to download the `teaching-tomster.png` image, which was referenced from our CSS file:

```css
.tomster {
  background: url(../assets/images/teaching-tomster.png);
  /* ...snip... */
}
```

As we learned earlier, the Ember convention is to place your source code in the `app` folder. For other assets like images and fonts, the convention is to put them in the `public` folder. We will follow this convention by downloading the `teaching-tomster.png` image file and placing it in `public/assets/images`.

Both Ember CLI and the development server understand these folder conventions and will automatically make these files available to the browser.

You can confirm this by navigating to
`http://localhost:4200/assets/images/teaching-tomster.png`. The image should also show up in the welcome page we have been working on. You may need to do a manual refresh for the browser to pick up the new file.
