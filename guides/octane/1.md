<!-- TODO: explain ember server, etc. -->

When you are done experimenting, go ahead and delete the `app/templates/application.hbs` file. We won't be needing this for a while, and can start afresh and add it back later when there we have a need for it.

If you still have your browser tab open, your tab should automatically reload into a blank page as you delete the file. This reflects the fact that we no longer have an application template in our app.
