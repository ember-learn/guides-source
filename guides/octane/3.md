Before we do anything else, let's add some styling to our app. We spend enough time staring at the computer screen as it is, we must protect our eyesight against unstyled markup!

Fortunately, our designer sent us some CSS for us to use, so we can just go ahead and copy this into `app.css` in the `app/styles` directory. This file has all the styles we need for building the rest of the app.

If you are familiar with CSS, feel free to customize them to your liking! Just keep in mind that you may see some visual differences going forward, if you choose to do so.

When you are ready, save the CSS changes in the file; our trusty development server should pick it up and refresh our page right away. No more unstyled content!
