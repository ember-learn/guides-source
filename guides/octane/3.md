Before we do anything else, let's add some styling to our app. We spend
enough time staring at the computer screen as it is, we must protect our
eyesight against unstyled markup!

Fortunately, our designer sent us some CSS for us to use, so we can just
go ahead and copy this into `app/styles/app.css`. This file has all the
styles we need for building the rest of the app.

If you are familiar with CSS, feel free to customize them to your
liking! Just keep in mind that you may see some visual differences going
forward, if you choose to do so.

When you are ready to save the CSS changes, our trusty development
server should pick it up and refresh our page right away. No more
unstyled content!
