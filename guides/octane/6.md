We're on a roll! While we're at it, let's add our third page. This time, things are a little bit different. Everyone at the company calls this the "contact" page. However, the old website we are replacing already has a similar page, which is served at the legacy URL `/getting-in-touch`.

We want to keep the existing URLs for the new website, but `getting-in-touch` is a mouthful to type and say out loud all the time! Fortunately, we can have the best of the both worlds:

<!-- TODO: format diff -->
```
Router.map(function() {
  this.route('about');
  this.route('contact', { path: '/getting-in-touch' });
});
```

Here, we add the `contact` route, but explicitly specify a path for the route. This allows us to keep the legacy URL, but use the new, shorter name for the route as well as the template filename.

Speaking of the template, let's create that as well. We'll add a `app/templates/contact.hbs` file:

```html
<div class="jumbo">
  <div class="right tomster"></div>
  <h2>Contact Us</h2>

    <a href="mailto:superrentalsrep@emberjs.com">superrentalsrep@emberjs.com</a>
  </address>
</div>
```

Ember comes with strong *[conventions](TODO: link to conventions)* and sensible defaults &mdash; if we were starting from scratch, we wouldn't mind the default `/contact` URL. However, if the defaults don't work for us, it is no problem at all to customize Ember for our needs!

Once you have added the route and the template above, we should have the new page available to us at `http://localhost:4200/getting-in-touch`.

Congratulations, you have completed your training as a master page-crafter!
