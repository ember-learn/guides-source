With our first page down, let's add another one!

This time, we would like the page to be served on the `/about` URL. In order to do this, we will need to tell Ember our plan to add a page at that location, otherwise Ember will think we have visited an invalid URL!

The place to manage what pages are available is the *[router](TODO: link to router)*. Go ahead and open `router.js` in the `app` directory and make the following change:

<!-- TODO: format diff -->
```
Router.map(function() {
  this.route('about');
});
```

This adds a *[route](TODO: link to route)* named "about", which is served at the `/about` URL by default. With that in place, we can create a new `about.hbs` template under `app/templates` with the following content:

<!-- TODO: format diff -->
```html
<div class="jumbo">
  <div class="right tomster"></div>
  <h2>About Super Rentals</h2>
  <p>
    The Super Rentals website is a delightful project created to explore Ember. By building a property rental site, we can simultaneously imagine traveling AND building Ember applications.
  </p>
</div>
```

To see this in action, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/about`.

<!-- TODO: screenshot? -->

With that, our second page is done!
