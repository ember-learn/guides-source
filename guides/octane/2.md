Create an `index.hbs` in `app/templates` and paste the following markup.

<!-- TODO: format diff -->
```html
<div class="jumbo">
  <div class="right tomster"></div>
  <h2>Welcome to Super Rentals!</h2>
  <p>We hope you find exactly what you're looking for in a place to stay.</p>
</div>
```

If you are thinking, "Hey, that looks like HTML!", then you would be right! In their simplest form, Ember templates are really just HTML. If you are already familiar with them, you should feel right at home here.

Of course, unlike HTML, Ember templates can do a lot more than just displaying static content. We will see that in action soon.

After saving the file, your browser tab should automatically refresh, showing us the welcome message we just worked on.
