Testing is a core part of the Ember framework and its development cycle.

Let's assume you are writing an Ember application which will serve as a blog. 
This application would likely include models such as `user` and `post`. It would 
also include interactions such as _login_ and _create post_. Let's finally 
assume that you would like to have [automated tests] in place for your application. 

There are two different classifications of tests that you will need: 
**Acceptance** and **Unit**.

### Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests are used to test user interaction and application flow. With 
the example scenario above, some acceptance tests you might write are:

* A user is able to log in via the login form.
* A user is able to create a blog post.
* A visitor does not have access to the admin panel.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are used to test isolated chunks of functionality, or "units", without 
worrying about their dependencies. Some examples of unit tests for the scenario 
above might be:

* A user has a role
* A user has a username
* A user has a fullname attribute which is the aggregate of its first and last 
  names with a space between
* A post has a title
* A post's title must be no longer than 50 characters

### Testing Frameworks

[QUnit] is the default testing framework for this guide, but others are 
supported through third-party addons.

### How to Run Your Tests

Run your tests with `ember test` on the command-line. You can re-run your tests on every file-change with `ember test --server`. For more details and options, see [Ember CLI â€“ Testing](http://www.ember-cli.com/#testing) and `ember help test`.

The Ember testing guide provides best practices and examples on how to test your
Ember applications. If you find any errors or believe the documentation can be
