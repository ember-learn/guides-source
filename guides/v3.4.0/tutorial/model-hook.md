Now, let's add a list of available rentals to the rentals page we've just created.

Ember keeps data for a page in an object called a `model`.
To keep things simple at first,
we'll populate the model for our rental listing page to use a hard-coded array of JavaScript objects.
Later, we'll switch to using [Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data),
a library for robustly managing data in our app.

Here's what our homepage will look like when we're done:

![super rentals homepage with rentals list](/images/model-hook/super-rentals-index-with-list.png)

In Ember, route handlers are responsible for loading the model with data for the page.
It loads the data in a function called [`model`](https://www.emberjs.com/api/ember/release/classes/Route/methods/model?anchor=model/).
The `model` function acts as a [hook](../../getting-started/core-concepts/#toc_hooks), meaning that Ember will call it for us during different times in our app.
The model function we've added to our `rentals` route handler will be called when a user navigates to the rentals route via root URL `http://localhost:4200`, or via `http://localhost:4200/rentals`.

Let's open `app/routes/rentals.js` and return an array of rental objects from the `model` function:

```javascript {data-filename="app/routes/rentals.js" data-diff="+4,+5,+6,+7,+8,+9,+10,+11,+12,+13,+14,+15,+16,+17,+18,+19,+20,+21,+22,+23,+24,+25,+26,+27,+28,+29,+30,+31,+32,+33"}
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';

export default Route.extend({
  model() {
    return [{
      id: 'grand-old-mansion',
      title: 'Grand Old Mansion',
      owner: 'Veruca Salt',
      city: 'San Francisco',
      category: 'Estate',
      bedrooms: 15,
      image: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Crane_estate_(5).jpg',
      description: 'This grand old mansion sits on over 100 acres of rolling hills and dense redwood forests.'
    }, {
      id: 'urban-living',
      title: 'Urban Living',
      owner: 'Mike TV',
      city: 'Seattle',
      category: 'Condo',
      bedrooms: 1,
      image: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Alfonso_13_Highrise_Tegucigalpa.jpg',
      description: 'A commuters dream. This rental is within walking distance of 2 bus stops and the Metro.'
    }, {
      id: 'downtown-charm',
      title: 'Downtown Charm',
      owner: 'Violet Beauregarde',
      city: 'Portland',
      category: 'Apartment',
      bedrooms: 3,
      image: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Wheeldon_Apartment_Building_-_Portland_Oregon.jpg',
      description: 'Convenience is at your doorstep with this charming downtown rental. Great restaurants and active night life are within a few feet.'
    }];
  }
});
```

Note that here, we are using the ES6 shorthand method definition syntax: `model()` is the same as writing `model: function()`.

Ember will use the model object returned above and save it as an attribute called `model`,
available to the rentals template we generated with our route in [Routes and Templates](../routes-and-templates/#toc_a-rentals-route).

Now, let's switch over to our rentals page template.
We can use the model attribute to display our list of rentals.
Here, we'll use another common Handlebars helper called [`{{each}}`](../../templates/displaying-a-list-of-items/).
This helper will let us loop through each of the rental objects in our model:

```handlebars {data-filename="app/templates/rentals.hbs" data-diff="+12,+13,+14,+15,+16,+17,+18,+19,+20,+21,+22,+23,+24,+25,+26,+27,+28"}
<div class="jumbo">
  <div class="right tomster"></div>
  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <p>
    We hope you find exactly what you're looking for in a place to stay.
  </p>
  {{#link-to "about" class="button"}}
    About Us
  {{/link-to}}
</div>

{{#each model as |rental|}}
  <article class="listing">
    <h3>{{rental.title}}</h3>
    <div class="detail owner">
      <span>Owner:</span> {{rental.owner}}
    </div>
    <div class="detail type">
      <span>Type:</span> {{rental.category}}
    </div>
    <div class="detail location">
      <span>Location:</span> {{rental.city}}
    </div>
    <div class="detail bedrooms">
      <span>Number of bedrooms:</span> {{rental.bedrooms}}
    </div>
  </article>
{{/each}}
```

In this template, we loop through each object.
On each iteration, the current object gets stored in a variable called `rental`.
From the rental variable in each step, we create a listing with information about the property.

You may move onto the [next page](../installing-addons/) to keep implementing new features, or continue reading on testing the app you've created.

### Application Testing the Rental List

To check that rentals are listed with an automated test, we will create a test to visit the index route and check that the results show 3 listings.

In `app/templates/rentals.hbs`, we wrapped each rental display in an `article` element, and gave it a class called `listing`.
We will use the listing class to find out how many rentals are shown on the page.


To find the elements that have a class called `listing`, we'll use the method [`querySelectorAll`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelectorAll).
The `querySelectorAll` method returns the elements that match the given [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors).
In this case it will return an array of all the elements with a class called `listing`.

```javascript {data-filename="tests/acceptance/list-rentals-test.js" data-diff="+2,+3"}
test('should list available rentals.', async function(assert) {
  await visit('/');
  assert.equal(this.element.querySelectorAll('.listing').length, 3, 'should display 3 listings');
});
```

Run the tests again using the command `ember t -s`, and toggle "Hide passed tests" to show your new passing test.

Now we are listing rentals, and verifying it with an application test.
This leaves us with 2 remaining application test failures (and 1 eslint failure):
