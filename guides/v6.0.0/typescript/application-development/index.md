Once you've got your Ember project up and running with TypeScript, this chapter can help you with:

- Advanced [configuration][] of your TypeScript project.
- [Testing][] of your TypeScript project.

Alternatively, you may have an existing Ember project, and you're wondering how to convert it to TypeScript. In that case, check out ["Converting an Existing Ember App to TypeScript"][converting-an-app].

Or perhaps, you're creating an addon and you'd like it to be written in TypeScript. We've got you covered [here][addons].
