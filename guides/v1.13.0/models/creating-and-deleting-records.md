You can create records by calling the `createRecord` method on the store.

```javascript
store.createRecord('post', {
  title: 'Rails is Omakase',
  body: 'Lorem ipsum'
});
```

The store object is available in controllers and routes using `this.store`.

Although `createRecord` is fairly straightforward, the only thing to watch out for
is that you cannot assign a promise as a relationship, currently.

For example, if you want to set the `author` property of a post, this would **not** work
if the `user` with id isn't already loaded into the store:

```javascript
var store = this.store;

store.createRecord('post', {
  title: 'Rails is Omakase',
  body: 'Lorem ipsum',
  author: store.findRecord('user', 1)
});
```

However, you can easily set the relationship after the promise has fulfilled:

```javascript
var store = this.store;

var post = store.createRecord('post', {
  title: 'Rails is Omakase',
  body: 'Lorem ipsum'
});

store.findRecord('user', 1).then(function(user) {
  post.set('author', user);
});
```

### Deleting Records

Deleting records is just as straightforward as creating records. Just call `deleteRecord()`
on any instance of `DS.Model`. This flags the record as `isDeleted` and thus removes
it from `all()` queries on the `store`. The deletion can then be persisted using `save()`.
Alternatively, you can use the `destroyRecord` method to delete and persist at the same time.

```javascript
store.findRecord('post', 1).then(function(post) {
  post.deleteRecord();
  post.get('isDeleted'); // => true
  post.save(); // => DELETE to /posts/1
});

// OR
store.findRecord('post', 2).then(function(post) {
  post.destroyRecord(); // => DELETE to /posts/2
});
```
