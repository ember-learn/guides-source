Are you wondering what the Octane equivalent is for some classic Ember features? Have a look at the [cheat sheet](https://ember-learn.github.io/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/)!

Topics in the [cheat sheet](https://ember-learn.github.io/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/) include:

- Tracked vs Computed Properties
- Native JavaScript Classes vs Ember Object
- Using `{{on}}` instead of the actions helper in templates
- Passing arguments

For many Octane features, there are codemods available as well, so be sure to read our [Upgrade Strategy Guide](../) before making changes like these by hand.
