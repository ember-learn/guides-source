To see a list of libraries used in your application, click on the `Info` menu. This view displays the libraries used, along with their version.

### Registering a Library

If you would like to add your own application or library to the list, you can register it using:

```javascript
Ember.libraries.register(libraryName, libraryVersion);
```

#### Ember Cli

If you're using the [ember-cli-app-version] addon, your application's name and version will be added to the list automatically.
