## Project layout

The Guides content takes the form of Markdown files (just like most READMEs).
Each minor version of Ember has its own directory within `/guides/`.
Pull requests should make edits to only the latest version of Ember,
except in the case of bug reports for broken links.
On `ember serve`, the Markdown files are turned into HTML
to create an app. Most of the functionality comes from 
[guidemaker](https://github.com/empress/guidemaker) and 
[guidemaker-ember-template](https://github.com/ember-learn/guidemaker-ember-template).
The styles come from [ember-styleguide](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-styleguide),
the shared home of components and stylesheets used throughout the family of 
Ember sites.

## Local Development

```sh
git clone git://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source.git

cd ../guides-source/
npm install
ember serve
```

## Running tests

Use `npm` to run tests instead of `ember`, since we have additional
tests like spellchecking that are not part of The Ember app's tests.

```
npm install
npm test
```

### Linting and spellchecking

The guides are spellchecked and linted for Markdown consistency. You can test your contributions by running `npm run lint::md`. Linting and spellchecking must pass or they will fail in Travis-CI.  See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on linting and spellchecking.
