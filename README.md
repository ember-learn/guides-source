## Contributing

Welcome and thanks for your help! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
for detailed instructions on how to format your work and submit a Pull Request.
First-time contributors are encouraged to choose issues that are labeled 
"help wanted" or "good for new contributors." If you have questions or
want a buddy to pair with, you can join the #-team-learning channel
in the [Ember Community Slack](https://ember-community-slackin.herokuapp.com/).

## Project layout

The Guides content takes the form of Markdown files (just like most READMEs).
Each minor version of Ember has its own directory within `/guides/`.
Pull requests should make edits to only the latest version of Ember,
except in the case of bug reports for broken links.

## Local Development
To see your changes locally, you need two repositories on your
computer. This repository, `guides-source` contains only written content
as markdown files, which are fetched and displayed by
[guides-app](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-app).

Before following the below instructions and making any changes, first-time
contributors should see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for
instructions on forking the `guides-source` and `guides-app`
repositories and making a first pull
request.

```sh
git clone git://github.com/ember-learn/guides-app.git
git clone git://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source.git

cd guides-source
npm link

cd ../guides-app/
npm i
npm link @ember-learn/guides-source
npm start
```
